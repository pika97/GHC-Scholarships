', '', 'The fire’s progression necessitated the Declaration of a State of Local ', 'Emergency (SOLE) for Strathcona County on May 5, 2009.

', 'Through May and June, their efforts were supported by a number of other ', 'resources including the Salvation Army and other community groups, municipal ', 'and industrial partners, provincial agencies and County departments. SCES also ', 'received assistance from residents (i.e. food provision, water hauling and fire ', 'break cultivation, etc.).   ', '', 'Approximately 90 forestry fire fighters from Sustainable Resource ', 'Development (SRD) were deployed into the area at the height of the event.

Excerpt - 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire Investigative Report  ', '', 'The following is an excerpt taken from the ', 'official fire investigation report of  ', 'Fire Marshal Dale Miller.1 ', '', ' On May 3, 2009 at 14:42 hours, ', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services 911 ', 'Centre received the first of thirty-four (34) calls ', 'reporting brush fires in the Heartland Industrial ', 'Region and in the Lamont County area east of ', 'Highway (Hwy) 830. This fire initiated at almost ', 'the exact same time as another major wild land ', 'fire was developing approximately 7 kilometers ', 'east of its location in the Lamont County region. ', '', 'At the time that these two fires were reported, it was the recorded hottest time of ', 'day (21.2-22.8ºC), with the lowest humidity (15-16%) and the highest winds (24-33 ', 'kph). Vegetation ground cover was very dry with little new (spring) growth ', 'occurring.  The high temperature and low humidity contributed to the creation of ', 'what is termed in the industry as a “cross-over”, which accelerates fire growth ', 'exponentially.

', '', 'Heartland Hall (Strathcona County Fire Station 4 at Hwy 15 and Hwy 830), ', 'Fire Station 5 (Baseline Rd and Cloverbar Rd, Sherwood Park) and Platoon ', 'Chief Nixon were simultaneously dispatched at 14:46 hours. ', '', 'Platoon Chief Nixon reported that while enroute to the fire scene he ', 'witnessed two distinctly separate columns of smoke visible on the northern ', 'horizon [see Figure 1].  The column to the west was consistent light grey  ', 'in colour with the occasional charge of dark brown  and increasing intensity. ', 'The smoke to the east (assumed at the time to be east of Hwy 830) was larger in ', 'diameter than the west fire but appeared to be less intense with consistently ', 'lighter coloured smoke.

', '', '2.3 Investigative Findings: ', '', 'We hypothesize that due to human activity and  machinery or vehicle ', 'failure, a fire initiated on the tinder dry vegetative ground debris and developed to ', 'where the fire spread rapidly, with the assistance of the wind…on the ground ', 'surface along the power line service road. The fire flanked into the adjacent tree ', 'stands where a greater fuel matrix is available. The fire back burned from the ', 'Point of Origin along the west aspect of the pipeline right-of-way (ROW) but did ', 'not cross east of the ROW due to a lack of fuels available (sand base trails and ', 'road) and low intensity fire (back burning along fine ground fuels). The back ', 'burning fire flanked into the west adjacent tree stand, and with an assistance of ', 'the predominate meteorological winds, enhanced the advancing northbound fire. ', 'These fire forces intensified the heat and travel speed even further which ', 'contributed to the development of the wildfire.

Enforcement of controls was heavily dependent on a ', '“neighborhood watch” system; residents were urged to report any “improper” ', 'burning to 911. Furthermore, although Bylaw 68-2000 authorized the issuance of ', 'fines for contravention of permit regulations, SCES personnel preferred to view ', 'any response to reports of improper burning as educational opportunities.

At this point there were approximately 35 fire fighters from SCES ', 'operating on the two fires.  ', '', 'On both sides of the highway, the fires ', 'were supplied with extremely dry conditions and ', 'relatively high winds.

', 'Concurrently, Fire Chief Darrell Reid was establishing the Department ', 'Operations Centre (DOC) at Fire Station #1 and activating the Emergency ', 'Operations Centre (EOC) in County Hall.

', '', ' RCMP and fire resources commenced with a voluntary evacuation of ', 'threatened residents, livestock and visitors to the Bruderheim Natural area, a ', 'popular motorized recreation vehicle spot.

', '', ' Unfortunately, the early morning of ', 'May 4 produced winds gusting to 50 km  ', 'from the west, which started large flare ups ', 'as the fire was pushed into high fuel loads.  ', 'At 03:00 hrs the west fire was deemed out ', 'of control in several areas due to the fact ', 'that crews were finding it difficult to travel ', 'in the wildland areas in darkness.    ', '', 'At dawn the high winds and ', 'temperature hindered firefighting efforts and both fires flared up again.  The main ', 'issue with fire growth was structure protection as more buildings were being ', 'threatened.  The majority of the effort on May 4 was spent in trying to protect ', 'homes, secure heavy equipment such as bulldozers with operators for building ', 'effective fire breaks and organizing command with multiple public and private ', 'agencies.  Provincial Sustainable Resources Development (SRD), Forestry ', 'Division, was able to immediately provide three air tanker groups that could drop ', '', 'a total of over 40,000 liters of fire retardant.  ', 'Even though this air support found ', 'operations difficult due to the size of the ', 'fire, there was some reprieve observed.

', '', ' May 5 maintained similar weather patterns with ever changing gusting ', 'winds and increased temperature with decreased humidity.  After 48 hours of ', 'extraordinary fire growth and even greater fire suppression efforts, 130 fire ', 'fighters, two air tanker groups, three bulldozer groups with three bulldozers per ', 'group, and a number of mutual aid resources were still working on restricting fire ', 'movement and protecting structures.   ', '', ' Although Mutual Aid Partners were released by the end of the first week, ', 'SCES fire fighters, Contractors and SRD crews continued to battle the wildfire ', 'over the next two months with varying success.  By the end of May, total fire ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 22 - December  2010 ', '', 'costs were estimated to be in excess of ', '$834,000.  Factors unrelated to the actual ', 'response also hindered their efforts. ', 'Interference from ATV operators in the ', 'area increased to a level that forced SRD ', 'crews to relocate their base of operations. ', 'At this point, SCES closed the area to all ', 'non-essential traffic and recreational use. ', 'This restriction remained in effect until the ', 'incident was deemed officially over.   ', '', ' During the last week of May, SRD crews began a formal demobilization, ', 'but maintained a presence at the scene, operating from their temporary base ', 'located near Station #4, Heartland Hall.  Throughout the month of June, both ', 'SRD and SCES crews continued to search out and deal with troublesome ', 'hotspots. These patrols continued until the 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire was ', 'officially declared extinguished on Friday, July 3, nearly ten weeks after the initial ', 'call to 911.  ', '', ' For a detailed timeline of this incident, please see Appendix 6. ', '', ' ', '', '1.2 Findings: ', '', 'a) Command and Coordination ', '', ' Command coordination was in place for the first 72 hours, but challenges ', 'with control were lacking in several areas.  The scope of the incident required a ', 'larger command structure than typically utilized by SCES.  Area Command was ', 'established at the onset with two separate commands reporting for day one; ', 'however, there was some confusion on this organization of command in the ', 'subordinate levels reporting to the separate East and West commands.    ', '', ' This was rectified at the start of day two, with Area Command and two ', 'subordinate geographic commands being abolished and replaced by a single ', 'Command, Operations Section and Divisions  being established as ', 'necessary. On day three, command became unified with SRD with Deputy ', 'Section Chiefs established as required. ', '', ' ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 23 - December  2010 ', '', 'As stated, control over outside agencies was lacking. Having mutual aid ', 'resources available was a definite benefit, but the size and intensity of the ', 'wildfire coupled with challenges in communication produced a risk for these ', 'resources.   ', '', ' Self-deployed resources were also a definite issue.  Research has shown ', 'that this type of “emergent activity” is common in disaster situations.  Invariably, ', 'there is a convergence of resources into the affected community, a “‘mass ', 'assault’ of independent and decentralized activity” (Perry, 1991, p.202; Wenger, ', '1992, p.3; Scawthorn and Wenger, 1990, p2-3; Auf der Heide, 1989, p.75; ', 'Wenger et.al., 1987, p.20 as cited in Drabek & McEntire, 2003, p.100). Often, ', '“groups … emerge to begin automatically responding to the needs of one ', 'another” without official sanction (Fischer, 2002, p.124). During times of ', 'community crisis, self-deployed or “emergent groups” represent “a potential ', 'source of knowledge, funds, equipment, and human resources” that may be ', 'critical to response or recovery efforts (Wachtendorf, 2001, p.11). On the other ', 'hand, as they commonly operate independent of traditional authority, such ', 'groups also have the potential of further disrupting response efforts that may ', 'already be strained (Fowler, 2008, p.1). ', '', 'One particular instance during the ', '2009 North Strathcona Fire supports this ', 'claim. A private corporation took the initiative ', 'to provide assistance that was not officially ', 'sanctioned. Although this company provides ', 'an excellent service, it does so at an elevated ', 'cost. In addition to escalated costs, because ', 'this company did not coordinate its efforts ', 'through area command, they not only created ', '', 'a potential duplication of effort, they also lacked access to information that could ', 'have been critical to the safety of their own resources. In other words, by not ', 'placing themselves under the established unified command, they became ', 'another “uncontrollable element in the response milieu whose appearance … ', '[created] complications for security and site safety” (Kendra & Wachtendorf, ', '2002, p.138).  ', '', 'b) Communications ', '', ' Communications, always an issue in emergent situations, presented ', 'several challenges during this incident. These challenges, however, helped to not ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 24 - December  2010 ', '', 'only identify some important deficiencies within SCES’ current radio system, but ', 'also identify possible solutions through a unique opportunity to test new ', 'technology introduced through the collaboration of two of its vendors.   ', '', ' In the past, radio communication to the northern area of Strathcona ', 'County has consistently proven ineffective, due mainly to the height and ', 'coverage of the radio tower in the Heartland area.  A new radio system had been ', 'purchased and put into operations approximately one year prior, which greatly ', 'reduced this deficiency; however, it was still being dealt with at the time the 2009 ', 'North fire occurred.   ', '', 'During this time frame, SCES, in partnership with Westcan ', 'Communication Services and Motorola, was conducting the first-in-the-world test ', 'of 4.9 Ghz technology.  The 2009 North Strathcona Fire provided the unexpected ', 'opportunity to field-test newly-developed bridging radio technology used as part ', 'of the trial. The bridge provides the user with the ability to “link” two different ', 'radio systems, giving the separate users the ability to speak with one another ', 'using their own radio equipment. There were challenges using a new system “on ', 'the fly”, but it did display some promise for future operations. In addition to the ', 'bridging technology, Westcan provided emergency radio assistance, portable ', 'towers and radio-coverage monitoring and service. ', '', 'Another communication challenge involved mutual aid and external auto-', 'deployed resources. With a finite number of SCES radios and personnel, it was ', 'difficult to assign either to external parties.  At times, mutual aid resources were ', 'held back because SCES Command had no method of communicating with ', 'them. Although cell phones filled this gap to a certain extent, this solution was far ', 'from ideal. A more effective solution was demonstrated in the deployment of an ', 'Edmonton Fire Battalion Chief to the SCES Incident Command Post (ICP). ', 'During the first 24 hours, this officer became the main point of communication ', 'between the Edmonton contingent and the area commander, promoting a swift ', 'and seamless transfer of crucial information between the two parties. ', '', 'c) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources ', '', 'Re-evaluation of fuel packets did occur at regular intervals with crews and ', 'resources requested and assigned as needed to protect the various well-heads ', 'and properties in the area. A more efficient use of mutual aid resources, ', 'however, could have been instituted.  Requests for mutual aid assistance were ', '“bunched” too closely together and as a result, resources were not evenly ', 'available or dispersed across operational periods.  In fact, at times, it was ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 25 - December  2010 ', '', 'discovered that mutual aid resources had been deemed surplus and released, as ', 'opposed to being staged and ready, just as the situation changed and the need ', 'for these resources became apparent.  ', '', 'Accountability for tracking team members was also problematic; it was not ', 'always maintained and teams did not always preserve group cohesion. This ', 'accountability issue was further confounded among external teams by ', 'unfamiliarity, not only with department-specific terminology but also with local ', 'geography. These challenges were alleviated to some degree by the use of the ', 'Incident Command System (ICS) and the inclusion of the Edmonton Fire ', 'Battalion Chief in incident command as mentioned previously in this section.  ', '', ' In fact, this suggests a solution that ', 'could have been easily expanded to ', 'integrate all mutual aid and county ', 'resources: divide field staff into “joint” ', 'teams; for example, group two SCES ', 'personnel with two mutual aid personnel. ', 'This not only addresses communication ', 'issues by providing each team with ', 'compatible radio technologies and ', 'common terminology, it also addresses ', '', 'geographical concerns. Furthermore, it ensures a “vested” interest within each ', 'team. Perhaps most importantly of all, however, such blended crews represent ', 'an increased ability to meet obligations with regard to crew safety.   ', '', 'd) Safety and Accountability ', '', 'To address issues noted above, a system of tracking resources and their ', 'location was developed and implemented within the first 72 hours.  Based on ICS ', 'principles, this system provided a consistent daily overview of who was on duty, ', 'what roles or functions were assigned and  performed and any safety issues ', 'encountered.  ', '', 'SCES also employed its traditional ', 'system of tracking employees using ', 'accountability tags attached to a “board”. ', 'These tags are assigned to each member at ', 'the commencement of their career with ', 'SCES, a system used in many departments ', 'throughout North America. Although this ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 26 - December  2010 ', '', 'system has proven efficient in smaller events, its use on a significant incident ', 'with multiple fronts proved far more challenging. As well, the accountability of ', 'external resources was identified as being less than adequate  ', 'at times. ', '', ' Safety and accountability was a particular issue in the first two days of the ', 'event.  Crews were worked extremely hard for extended hours with little to no ', 'rehabilitation scheduled. Crews that initially responded to the incident had been ', 'on duty since 06:00 hrs that morning, but were held by necessity on the ', 'fireground until approximately 23:00 hrs that night. Not only did this increase the ', 'risk of error or injury, it also revealed a serious flaw in the planning process; a ', 'reactive rather than proactive mentality which gave little thought towards what ', 'resources SCES had in reserve for the future or left in place for day to day ', 'operations. SCES’ human resource profile at the onset of the incident was lean. ', 'Fire officers and fire fighters faced an ever changing event with an ever changing ', 'roster of part time fire fighters, mutual aid and external, auto-deployed resources. ', 'In fact, at one point, staffing pressures caused recruits still in their orientation ', 'period to be called into active duty. Although Occupational Health and Safety ', '(OHS) Codes require such members to be under the direct supervision of a ', 'competent worker, this was not always the case.   ', '', ' SCES, however, prides itself on the direction of safety in the station and ', 'on the fireground.  Within the first 24 hours of this event, the issue of time and ', 'resource management was brought forward and addressed.  Over the next two ', 'days, one person was assigned the duty of better organizing personnel. ', 'Consistent, scheduled shifts of eight to ten hours were established for fire ', 'fighters on an overtime basis to ensure regular shifts were not impacted. At the ', 'onset, the shifts consisted of eight to twelve fire fighters with officers; as the ', 'event decelerated, shifts of two to six fire fighters were established.  This proved ', 'useful as the mode turned to the overhaul stage.  Fire fighters were able to ', 'respond to smaller incidents in the region while SRD provided support for ', 'ongoing wildland firefighting in the north.  ', '', ' Personnel Accountability Report (PAR) checks were also completed at ', 'every shift, however, this was done on a sporadic basis at best; units and groups ', 'were largely left to their own devices.  Although a rudimentary sign-in procedure ', 'was used at the Incident Command Post (ICP) in an attempt to track mutual aid ', 'and private resources, a more formalized process would definitely have enabled ', 'more efficient coordination and accountability of resources. Daily Safe Work ', 'Plans, establishing pertinent hazards, controls and procedures to mitigate ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 27 - December  2010 ', '', 'hazards and risk also provide better risk management for larger events of longer ', 'duration. This is a common SRD practice that has since been adopted by SCES.   ', '', ' Fortunately, only two relatively minor injuries were reported during the ', 'entire event, and both involved external personnel.  This is an important statistic, ', 'considering that the size and scope of this event was beyond anything the ', 'department had encountered in the past.   ', '', 'e) Incident Command System (ICS) Utilization  ', '', ' Although, as mentioned previously, ICS principles were employed to track ', 'accountability and safety, the ICS hierarchical structure, itself, was not developed ', 'at a pace appropriate to incident progression. Several vital roles were not filled ', 'until serious issues were encountered.  A delay in appointing Staging and ', 'Logistics Officers, for example, caused a delay in the establishment of a staging ', 'area distinct and separate from the camp area set aside for food, rest and ', 'maintenance breaks. This created several points of confusion. Arriving resources ', 'had no clear reporting point and had difficulty checking in. Staged resources ', 'mingled with those out of service and were then not readily available for ', 'deployment. Having Staging and Logistics Officers in place immediately ensures ', 'an early ability to track and move the right resources to the right place at the right ', 'time. Moreover, through the early establishment of separate, distinct and ', 'supervised staging and camp areas, these resources are usually physically ', 'located where they are expected to be.  ', '', ' Another ICS role that would have ', 'dramatically increased operational ', 'efficiency is the Officer “Scribe”.  Scribes ', 'can greatly facilitate information transfer ', 'and buffer their officers from unnecessary ', 'interruption. More importantly, they ', 'enable a thoroughly detailed and accurate ', 'incident progression record for later ', 'analysis and cost recovery applications.  ', '', ' ', ' ', '', 'f) Logistics ', '', 'Apart from issues noted in previous sections, the major logistical ', 'challenges faced in this incident dealt either with food and water provision for ', 'responders and evacuees, or identification and management of vendors and ', 'contractors for required resources.  ', '', 'Location of command post, day 1. ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 28 - December  2010 ', '', 'In order to meet the obligation of ensuring adequate provision for ', 'evacuees and responders, SCES called in the Salvation Army to provide food ', 'support from the initial onset throughout the first month of the incident, with some ', 'assistance from Shell Scotford’s catering service. As the event proceeded, a ', 'number of helpful residents also sought to assist in this regard, but with ', 'questionable results.  As in any situation where food is provided on a ', '“commercial” or “public” basis, it is crucial to ensure that the providers meet ', 'Alberta Health Requirements.  This is generally done through a rigorous ', 'inspection of the preparation process, which is not always possible when food is ', 'prepared off-site or in non-professional kitchens.  For this reason, food offerings ', 'were not always received in the spirit in which they were given.  In fact, in one ', 'particular instance, a complaint was made that SCES fire fighters had refused or ', 'thrown food away, untouched, in front of the donors who had brought it. The ', 'complaint was investigated, but due to a lack of recorded evidence, it was ', 'impossible to determine the exact details. Fortunately, this appears to have been ', 'an isolated episode, but nevertheless, SCES personnel were instructed to be ', 'more circumspect in future.  ', '', 'In addition to issues revolving around food preparation, there were also ', 'challenges with how it was distributed and to whom.  To address hygiene issues ', 'in the field, handwash stations at eating or catering areas could have ensured ', 'decreased cross contamination. With regard to distribution issues, a system of ', 'meal tickets (with accompanying instructions on where and how to use them) ', 'could have provided better controls on actual food consumption. ', '', 'A second major logistical challenge ', 'dealt with the identification and ', 'management of vendors and contractors for ', 'other required resources, such as bull ', 'dozers and sanitation equipment (porta ', 'potties).  It was sometimes difficult to ', 'differentiate between officially contracted ', 'and “emergent” (self-deployed) resources.  ', 'Required information, such as Occupational ', '', 'Health and Safety (OHS) and Worker Compensation Board (WCB) compliance, ', 'or details on billing and service agreements, was not always provided.  As well, ', 'verification and  tracking of actual services rendered proved lacking at times.  ', '', 'Several solutions for these issues were suggested during the debriefing ', 'sessions.  One of the most practical was the creation of a “Pre-approved Vendor ', 'List”, a list of contractors and vendors who have agreed to provide necessary ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 29 - December  2010 ', '', 'resources at a pre-negotiated price during emergency events.  This would ensure ', 'provision of resources that are properly trained and compatible within the ', 'guidelines of SCES operations as well as a full understanding of vendor ', 'processes and expectations before the contracted work is undertaken.  ', '', 'In addition to the Approved Vendor list, a proper check-in  system, ', 'such as a time clock, could ensure proper tracking controls are in place. An ', 'official system of identification, such as magnetic door logos for official contractor ', 'vehicles, is also needed to clearly differentiate them from self-deployed ', 'resources.  These solutions not only address the need for timely provision of ', 'appropriate resources and responsible financial oversight, but also increase site ', 'safety and security.    ', '', 'g) Situational Awareness ', '', ' Initial size-up and strategies involved in dealing with two concurrent ', 'wildfires was difficult with limited human resources.  As well, the sheer size of the ', 'area, coupled with topographical features such as heavy brush and limited sight-', 'lines, impeded the rapid collection of accurate and comprehensive intelligence at ', 'ground level.  These difficulties were quickly resolved once aerial ', 'reconnaissance had been obtained and Strathcona County’s Geographic ', 'Information Systems (GIS) Department began plotting the data onto meaningful ', 'and detailed maps.   ', '', 'h) Planning and Training  ', '', ' Deficiencies and challenges were also noted in the areas of planning and ', 'training.  One major deficiency lay in the fact that although the SCES portion of ', 'the County’s Emergency Response Plan was up to date in electronic draft ', 'format, this information had not yet been made official or shared with key ', 'personnel in hard copy format as per normal process. As a result, the plan was ', 'found lacking when put into play and valuable time was wasted in re-gathering ', 'crucial information.   ', '', ' This deficiency is a common issue in emergency management. Although ', 'research suggests more emphasis should be placed on the planning process ', 'than the plan, itself (Wachtendorf and Kendra, 2006), this does not always ', 'happen. It can be difficult for staff facing other work demands, to justify spending ', 'the necessary time preparing and planning for something that may never happen ', '(Fowler, 2008).  To address this issue, SCES piloted a Strathcona County ', 'Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) in January 2010, whose mandate ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 30 - December  2010 ', '', 'and focus is to redesign and improve the County’s existing emergency ', 'management and business continuity plans and processes.   ', '', ' Also related to a planning deficiency was the fact that SCES did not have ', 'personnel with Dozer Boss Training for constructing proper dozer (fire) guards. ', 'This is a tactic strongly recommended and used by SRD.  Having properly ', 'trained staff right at the outset can drastically and immediately restrict fire ', 'extension.  Not having this capability for the first two days severely limited SCES’ ', 'ability to complete an early, efficient strategic fire containment.  Since this ', 'incident, Strathcona County has trained and certified six Strathcona County ', 'employees in proper dozer guard construction tactics.

', '', '\\uf0b7 Smooth communication with and integration of mutual aid resources ', 'proved challenging.

', '', '\\uf0b7 Control and coordination of self deployed resources (emergent ', 'activity or groups) can also become a challenge in large incidents.   ', 'A consistent system and process, such as a pre-approved vendor ', 'list, can facilitate identification and  coordination of unauthorized ', 'activity into the authorized response.  ', '', '\\uf0b7 A pre-approved vendor list and contracting system for heavy ', 'equipment also ensures provision of resources that are properly ', 'trained and compatible within the guidelines of SCES operations  ', 'and prior full understanding of vendor processes and expectations.  ', '', '\\uf0b7 OHS obligations require that recruits who have not completed their ', 'orientation period be under the direct supervision of a competent ', 'worker at all times. Such supervision, however, may not always be ', 'feasible. Where resource needs require the deployment of such ', 'inexperienced recruits, their roles should be limited to those which ', 'do not put them at risk (i.e. aide  duties, logistical support, ', 'rehabilitation or medical monitoring).  continued next page ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 31 - December  2010 ', '', ' ', '', '1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned (cont’d) ', '\\uf0b7 Fire crews working extended hours with little to no scheduled ', '', 'rehabilitation increases the risk of error or injury.

EOC Operation ', '', 'Data on the operation, ', 'performance and staffing of the EOC ', 'was gathered in the following manner. ', '', 'On September 30, 2009, an EOC ', 'Debrief was conducted by SCES.  Over ', 'the four days preceding this debrief, ', 'telephone surveys were individually ', 'conducted with County Staff who were ', 'identified from the EOC registration ', '', 'sheets.

A summary of survey findings was used to ', 'stimulate thought and generate further discussion at the formal debriefing ', 'session.  The remainder of this Section deals with information so gathered. ', '', '1.1  Observations ', '', 'In late afternoon of May 3 as the magnitude of the 2009 North Strathcona ', 'Wildfire first became apparent, the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was ', 'activated in Conference Centre #1, County Hall, only to be stood down shortly ', 'after midnight when conditions appeared to indicate the fire was under control.

The Department Operations Centre ', '(DOC) located at Fire Hall #1 was also run in conjunction with the EOC on ', 'various occasions during that same week.  ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 36 - December  2010 ', '', '1.2 Findings: ', '', 'a) The initial response ', '', ' In keeping with lessons learned from the 2008 North Strathcona Fire, the ', 'EOC was opened at an early stage of the incident. An overly optimistic analysis ', 'of the situation, however, led to the erroneous conclusion that the EOC was ', 'redundant long before a true sense of the incident had been obtained.  Ironically, ', 'although this decision was no doubt influenced by a natural desire to minimize ', 'inconvenience to EOC staff and maximize operational efficiency, it had exactly ', 'the opposite effect to that intended.  ', '', 'b) Command Coordination and ICS ', '', 'As mentioned previously, the EOC and the DOC were run in conjunction ', 'from two separate locations during the initial week of the incident. Running two ', 'simultaneous operations centres, however, has the potential to create confusion ', 'and does not follow proper ICS Chain of Command ideology. Ideally, the EOC ', 'should run the entire event with the DOC element physically represented within ', 'the same location. This avoids duplication of effort and delayed access to ', 'important and often time sensitive information.   ', '', 'c) Communications ', '', 'Overall, survey respondents and debrief participants felt that ', 'communication within the EOC (i.e. about the event, assigned tasks, feedback on ', 'tasks, etc.) was effective. The on time, regular “as promised” briefings, in ', 'particular, were cited by participants as a major positive process.  ', '', 'One or two areas of concern, however, were identified by Legislative and ', 'Legal Services (LLS), the department responsible to keep a record of the actions ', 'and decisions made in the course of the emergency. Oftentimes, these ', 'representatives were not able to capture these points, either because they were ', 'not included in key conversations or were physically located too far away from ', '‘the action’ to hear the discussions. According to one participant: “Relying on ', 'overheard conversations is not conducive to good recordkeeping, yet that is often ', 'the way we were able to capture anything”. ', '', 'Adding to this concern was the fact that the EOC forms intended to ', 'capture a decision or action were not consistently completed and  provided to ', 'LLS. Accurate and timely completion and provision of these forms would not only ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 37 - December  2010 ', '', 'provide a more complete historical record of the event, it would also greatly ', 'enhance the accuracy and completeness of the regular briefings provided to ', 'participants as the incident progressed.  One suggestion for improvement ', 'generated during the debriefing was to provide these forms and briefings in an ', 'electronic format.  This format would allow all participants to access updated ', 'information at their convenience and to communicate asynchronously to avoid ', 'unnecessary workflow disruptions.  ', '', 'This electronic format would necessitate access to the County’s email and ', 'document management system within the EOC, which was another suggestion ', 'for improvement generated from the debrief session.  It was felt that such access ', 'would encourage staff whose offices are located within County Hall, to remain at ', 'their station in the EOC rather than returning to their desks to check on day to ', 'day tasks.  Such absences have not only the potential to delay or interrupt EOC ', 'workflow, but can also create a secondary disruptive effect in the form of ', 'extraneous conversation or “bustle” as staff members enter or leave the room.   ', '', 'One participant reported “there was a sense that if you left the EOC for ', 'any length of time, you needed to catch up quickly” (SCES, 2009).  Provision of ', 'regular bulleted points of development and updates on the outside world, as well ', 'as a “daily summary” at shift changes, was one learning identified that helped to ', 'provide direction and avoid duplication of work and unnecessary interruptions of ', 'other staff.  It is also important to ensure that all visitors and staff in the EOC are ', 'aware of communication and confidentiality protocols. ', '', 'd) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources ', '', 'Initial staffing for the EOC ', 'was composed of the Chief ', 'Commissioner in his role as ', 'Director of Emergency ', 'Management and key personnel ', 'from SCES, Corporate Planning & ', 'Intergovernmental Affairs (CPIA) ', 'and Communications, the three ', 'departments most impacted at the ', 'onset of the incident. As the ', 'incident progressed, it became ', '', 'evident that support from other departments would be required. Staff from ', 'Legislative and Legal Services (LLS), Transportation and Agriculture Services ', '(TAS) and Information Technology Services (ITS) were called in on May 4 to fill ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 38 - December  2010 ', '', 'the roles previously established for their respective departments through the ', 'Strathcona County Emergency Preparedness Plan.  In addition to internal County ', 'Staff, a representative from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency ', '(AEMA) was also in attendance to provide a link to related activities happening ', 'simultaneously in other neighboring jurisdictions. ', '', 'Overall, survey and debrief results indicated that “virtually everyone felt ', 'they knew their roles” although there was some confusion “caused by people ', 'being asked to perform unaccustomed tasks”.  This confusion appeared directly ', 'related to the fact that not all staff in attendance had had previous experience ', 'working in the EOC environment and were thus unsure of the expectations ', 'associated with their assigned role (SCES, 2009). One suggestion to ensure role ', 'competency is to institute a competency “sign-off” for EOC roles.   ', '', 'e) Safety and Accountability ', '', 'One problem noted within EOC operations was inadequate security and ', 'identification of authorized EOC personnel. The current location of the EOC is ', 'too accessible to the outside world (i.e. large windows) and does not effectively ', 'balance security with access.  ', '', 'As well, although a well-established registration process (and provision of ', 'ID tags for EOC participants) does exist, it was not followed consistently, which ', 'resulted in an incomplete registration record of EOC participants. This came to ', 'light during the debrief, when several County Staff members questioned why they ', 'had not been invited to participate in the survey although they had been part of ', 'EOC operations.   ', '', 'Several participants also reported having issues with people “wandering ', 'in” or “hanging out” in the EOC longer than was strictly necessary. Others ', 'commented on the lack of a clear process on getting information into or out of the ', 'EOC with a minimum of interruption. One participant questioned whether or not ', 'EOC operations conformed to the County’s Occupational Health and Safety ', 'Rules on working alone.   ', '', 'One suggested solution to these issues was to create an “EOC Security ', 'Officer ” role. The presence of the Security Officer could not only serve to ', 'discourage and reduce unauthorized and  unnecessary “visitors”, but could ', 'also facilitate timely contact with the right person at the right time.  This position ', 'could be staffed from any department; it is one opportunity for people from other ', 'departments to fill non-command roles and increase their comfort level with the ', 'inner workings of an EOC. ', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', '', '2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report ', '', 'Strathcona County Emergency Services - 39 - December  2010 ', '', 'f) Logistics ', 'Of all operational aspects, ', '', 'the logistical set-up of the EOC ', 'generated the most discussion. ', 'Although many participants ', 'commented on the calm, ', 'supportive and respectful ', 'environment that existed during ', 'its operation, several critical ', 'technological and physical gaps ', 'were identified: ', '', ' ', 'Technological Gaps ', '', '\\uf0b7 Existing processes and procedures don’t support new technology ', '\\uf0b7 GIS and mapping tools located within the EOC are seriously outdated ', '\\uf0b7 Inadequate access to basic office equipment such as photocopiers, ', '', 'printers and faxes ', '\\uf0b7 Inadequate capacity for laptop networking and connections ', '\\uf0b7 Antiquated phone system ', '\\uf0b7 No support TV  monitor for live news feeds or contact with outside ', '', 'events ', '', 'Physical gaps: ', '\\uf0b7 Set up of room is dictated by antiquated phone system and is not the best ', '', 'use of space: ', '\\uf034 busiest departments (i.e. SCES, RCMP, Fleet and Communications) ', '', 'are all located in one corner of the room ', '\\uf034 set up of room was confusing, cramped with blocked sight-lines ', '\\uf034 desks facing the wall not conducive to feeling of “inclusiveness” ', '\\uf034 No “break-out” rooms or “living environment” for night time operations ', '', 'or food  breaks ', '\\uf0b7 No clear floor plan provided to reduce set up time  ', '\\uf0b7 No floor plan and  schedule provided outside the room to clearly identify ', '', 'positions and roles.

This solution ', 'is problematic, however, as it runs directly counter to the need (as discussed in ', 'the previous section) of discouraging and reducing unauthorized and  ', 'unnecessary “visitors”.  Furthermore, as research into best practices indicates ', 'that ICS is becoming the national standard for handling emergency situations in ', 'both Canada and the United States, future Strathcona EOC activations will be ', 'transitioning towards an ICS-based operation.

It occurred approximately seven  kilometers away from a simultaneous wildfire  in a neighboring municipality and rapidly  expanded to produce the largest forest and  wildland fire the County experienced in over  20 years. It is significant to note that the  natural forested area just north west of this  location suffered a similar, but smaller wildfire  in May of the previous year.   The fire’s progression necessitated the Declaration of a State of Local  Emergency (SOLE) for Strathcona County on May 5, 2009. Although the  declaration was terminated two days later on May 7, SCES crews remained at  work in the area until July 3 when the incident was officially declared to be over.   Through May and June, their efforts were supported by a number of other  resources including the Salvation Army and other community groups, municipal  and industrial partners, provincial agencies and County departments. SCES also  received assistance from residents (i.e. food provision, water hauling and fire  break cultivation, etc.).    Approximately 90 forestry fire fighters from Sustainable Resource  Development (SRD) were deployed into the area at the height of the event. They  remained in the area approximately three to four weeks after the fire was under  control to assist SCES crews dealing with stubborn areas of dead brush, trees  and peat.    In total, the fire is estimated to have impacted an area of over 8,500 acres  of land; 14 times the size of the fire which occurred in 2008. It  briefly crossed the  North Saskatchewan River into Sturgeon County, and incurred a total cost to  Strathcona County of approximately $4.7 Million. Despite the size and complexity  of the event, however, the three major goals set by SCES at the outset were met.  No residents were injured, no homes were lost and only two minor firefighter  injuries occurred.         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 2 - December  2010  1. Approach  This After Action Report (AAR) describes the activities of Strathcona  County and its mutual aid partners in response to that portion of the fire affecting  the North Strathcona area. It incorporates the views of persons at all levels and  includes all available data gathered from participating organizations.   Data was compiled through a series of surveys, debriefings, GIS mapping  applications and a review of all fire-related department records. It was analyzed  using a qualitative approach and the results broken into six principle sections.    Section A: Strathcona County, Alberta provides a synopsis of  Strathcona County governance and emergency management policies in place  during the incident. It concludes with an overview of Strathcona County  Emergency Services (SCES) history, organization and other issues impacting the  department at the time.  Section B: Prevention Measures looks at policies and  measures taken to prevent and  mitigate the effects of wildfire in Strathcona  County, both before and after the incident. Section C: Field Operations  investigates all aspects of the response effort in the field during the course of the  wildfire, including that of Emergency Social Services (ESS) provided to  evacuees. Section D: The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) examines the  performance of the EOC in support of field operations. Section E: Public  Communications deals with all aspects of communication with the public,  specifically public alerting, updates and media notification.  Section F:  Remediation and Cost Recovery deals with remediation efforts undertaken in  the area, as well as subsequent cost recovery measures.   Information in the above noted sections is organized in a standard format:  observations describe what transpired; findings present and analyze what was  learned from the perspective of the response participants; recommendations  and lessons learned describe “potential improvements that were naturally  derived from the findings” (Titan Systems Corporation, n.d., p.2).  The report concludes with a list of References from both academic and  field research sources, and a series of Appendices, both of which offer  supplementary or background information to support the claims and statements  made in the preceding sections.   The remainder of this introduction provides a context for the reader  through an excerpt from the 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire Investigation Report,  and concludes with an executive summary of best practice recommendations for  improved performance in future disaster events.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 3 - December  2010  2. Excerpt - 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire Investigative Report   The following is an excerpt taken from the  official fire investigation report of   Fire Marshal Dale Miller.1   On May 3, 2009 at 14:42 hours,  Strathcona County Emergency Services 911  Centre received the first of thirty-four (34) calls  reporting brush fires in the Heartland Industrial  Region and in the Lamont County area east of  Highway (Hwy) 830. This fire initiated at almost  the exact same time as another major wild land  fire was developing approximately 7 kilometers  east of its location in the Lamont County region.  At the time that these two fires were reported, it was the recorded hottest time of  day (21.2-22.8ºC), with the lowest humidity (15-16%) and the highest winds (24-33  kph). Vegetation ground cover was very dry with little new (spring) growth  occurring.  The high temperature and low humidity contributed to the creation of  what is termed in the industry as a “cross-over”, which accelerates fire growth  exponentially.   This specific area is frequented by off road vehicle users, equestrian  enthusiasts, as well as oil and gas and power line servicemen.  Heartland Hall (Strathcona County Fire Station 4 at Hwy 15 and Hwy 830),  Fire Station 5 (Baseline Rd and Cloverbar Rd, Sherwood Park) and Platoon  Chief Nixon were simultaneously dispatched at 14:46 hours.  Platoon Chief Nixon reported that while enroute to the fire scene he  witnessed two distinctly separate columns of smoke visible on the northern  horizon [see Figure 1].  The column to the west was consistent light grey   in colour with the occasional charge of dark brown  and increasing intensity.  The smoke to the east (assumed at the time to be east of Hwy 830) was larger in  diameter than the west fire but appeared to be less intense with consistently  lighter coloured smoke. Based on the size and reading of the smoke conditions,  dispatch was directed to respond additional tankers, brush trucks and engine  crews from Sherwood Park as well as the outlying stations, page command  officers and address the need for mutual aid.                                                                1 The full fire report is available upon written request to the Fire Chief and Manager of Strathcona County  Emergency Services.                         Dale Miller, Fire Marshal  Strathcona County Emergency Services        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 4 - December  2010              2.1 Life Assessment  Based on the initial assessment of dispatch information, the potential for  fire extension, the fuel load involved and the proximity of residential buildings, it  was determined that there was immediate threat to civilian and animal life as a  result of the incident.  2.2 Exposure Concerns  Based on consideration of the fuel load, wind, moisture conditions, grade  of terrain and fire extension prior to our arrival on scene, it was concluded that  there was significant opportunity for extension outward along the eastern and  western flanks of the fire. While the leading edge was being directed towards   the river, the intensity of the fire and fuel packages in the area presented a   significant concern that the river width would fail to completely contain the fire   on the north front.  2.3 Investigative Findings:  We hypothesize that due to human activity and  machinery or vehicle  failure, a fire initiated on the tinder dry vegetative ground debris and developed to  where the fire spread rapidly, with the assistance of the wind…on the ground  surface along the power line service road. The fire flanked into the adjacent tree  stands where a greater fuel matrix is available. The fire back burned from the  Point of Origin along the west aspect of the pipeline right-of-way (ROW) but did  not cross east of the ROW due to a lack of fuels available (sand base trails and  road) and low intensity fire (back burning along fine ground fuels). The back  burning fire flanked into the west adjacent tree stand, and with an assistance of  the predominate meteorological winds, enhanced the advancing northbound fire.  These fire forces intensified the heat and travel speed even further which  contributed to the development of the wildfire.  Figure 1: Smoke columns, May 3, 2009      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 5 - December  2010  Relying upon deductive reasoning this hypothesis led to the following  conclusion.  2.4 Investigative Conclusion:   This fire is deemed Accidental in nature.  Due to the absence of evidence, we are not able to completely rule out  incendiarism, however, having two fires initiating at the same time of day  several kilometers apart and confirming that both areas had heavy  recreational activity occurring, the balance of probabilities weights on the  fire being accident in nature and caused by human activity and   machinery or vehicle failure.  FIRE ORIGIN:   On ground litter debris located:  Her Majesty – Alberta Energy  SE 22–56–21-W4  Northing 5969117.700, Easting 63912300  (NAD 83 3TM Central Meridian 114 Degrees West)  West aspect of pipeline ROW south of TWP 562, west of Range Rd 212  Strathcona County, Alberta  [Please see Appendix 1 for an aerial map of the area of origin. For further  details on the size of the fire as it appeared on May 3, please see  Appendix 2 for a map of its perimeter.]  FIRE CAUSE:   The Cause of the fire is Undetermined… At this time we are not able to  test a hypothesis without a reliable ignition source. The balance of  probabilities weights on the fire being caused by human activity and   machinery or vehicle failure.  End of excerpt as cited from Miller (2010).          2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 6 - December  2010  3. Executive Summary   In view of the size and complexity of  the event, that no residents were injured,  no homes were lost and no serious  firefighter injuries occurred is a major  accomplishment for Strathcona County  Emergency Services (SCES). In fact, SRD  forestry workers commented, “all our staff  were very impressed by the county’s  commitment to evacuations and structural  protection. Thought it was top notch all the  way…The fire departments did an excellent  job at providing… protection on this  …incident” (as cited in Reid, June, 2009).    This could not have been achieved  without assistance and support from SCES  Mutual Aid and Industrial partners, some of  whom were engaged in dealing with their own emergencies. Sturgeon and  Lamont Counties, for example, were fighting simultaneous wildfires in their  respective jurisdictions. Fortunately, SRD resources were available to respond  and their assistance and expertise greatly enhanced the response effort.   SCES also gratefully acknowledges assistance and support received from  residents. This ranged from tasks such as water hauling, food provision, livestock  evacuation and tilling of fields for firebreaks, to cooperation with evacuations and  area restrictions.    All County Departments made  ongoing, invaluable contributions to  the effort in both response and  recovery phases. In fact, this was a  major learning derived from the  incident; all departments play a role  in disaster response.     Other lessons learned  involved best practices in public  communication and notification,  utilizing community resources and      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 7 - December  2010  provision of support for affected residents2. Additional learnings highlighted the  advantages of public education, ongoing training for SCES and other County  staff, and a “proactive approach towards ‘all-hazards’ emergency preparedness”  (Reid, June, 2009).    The incident proved challenging in many respects and generated several  recommendations for improvement. Some of these recommendations have  already been addressed and  implemented, including:   refinement of prevention, preparedness and emergency notification  policies and procedures in Strathcona County, including a  Strathcona County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA)  pilot project   creation of a wider public awareness of such policies, procedures  and measures   full adoption and training in Incident Command System (ICS)  concepts across all Strathcona County departments for all  employees involved in the response to major emergencies   continued wildland fire training for SCES members   continued training and practice in emergency social service (ESS),  public information and emergency operations centre (EOC) roles  for County employees and potential volunteers   refinement of remediation and cost tracking practices for   optimum recovery                                                                     2 Emergency Social Services (ESS)      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 8 - December  2010  Section A: Strathcona County, Alberta  To provide further context for this After Action Report, Section A presents  a synopsis of Strathcona County governance and emergency management  policies in place during the incident. It concludes with an overview of Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES) history, organization and other issues  impacting the department at the time.      1. The Municipality  Ranked among Alberta’s five largest municipalities (Alberta Municipal  Affairs, 2010), Strathcona County is a unique blend of rural, urban and industrial  development located in the capital region on the eastern boundary of the City of  Edmonton. Occupying an area of 1,265 square kilometers with a population of  87,998 (as of the 2009 Census), the County consists of the “urban area of  Sherwood Park and an extensive rural area… which includes eight rural hamlets,  Antler Lake, Ardrossan, Collingwood Cove, Half Moon Lake, Hastings Lake,  Josephburg, North Cooking Lake and South Cooking Lake.”   To provide for “the unique needs of a municipality that includes both a  large urban centre and a significant rural territory and population”, the County  was classified as a specialized municipality in 1996, one of only five in the  province.  This means that the “Sherwood Park Urban Service Area is  recognized as the equivalent to a city by the Government of Alberta, and the  Rural Service Area (meaning the territory of Strathcona County excluding the  Sherwood Park Urban Service Area) for the purposes of enactments, is treated  as a municipal district” (Strathcona County, 2007).  1.1 Governance and Emergency Management Policies  This specialized municipality is governed by a nine-member Council led by  a Mayor (elected at large), and one Councillor for each of the eight political  wards, all serving rotating three-year terms. In the calendar year 2009, Cathy  Olesen served as Mayor and Jacquie Fenske served as Councillor for Ward 5,  the area most impacted by the fire. The remaining Council was composed of Vic  Bidzinski (Ward 1), Roxanne Carr (Ward 2), Peter Wlodarczak (Ward 4), Alan  Dunn (Ward 6), Glen Lawrence (Ward 7) and Jason Gariepy (Ward 8).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 9 - December  2010        County Administration is led by a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), who  is known as the Chief Commissioner, appointed by Council according to Section  205 of the Municipal Governance Act (Strathcona County, 2005). In Strathcona,  the Chief Commissioner leads an Executive Team which includes four Associate  Commissioners, each responsible for one of the County’s four administrative  divisions: Capital Region Initiatives3, Corporate Services, Community Services  and Infrastructure and Planning Services. Together, they oversee almost 2,000  full time, part time and seasonal Strathcona County employees, to provide a wide  range of services to County residents, business and industry (please see  Appendix 3 for the 2009 Strathcona County Divisional Organization chart).  In 2009, Robyn Singleton served as Chief Commissioner of Strathcona  County. Denise Exton was Associate Commissioner, Community Services, the  division which includes the Emergency Services department.   Remaining  members of the Executive Team were David Turner (Capital Region Initiatives),  George Huybregts (Corporate Services) and Peter Vana (Infrastructure &  Planning Services).                                                                        3 This Administrative Division was discontinued in 2010.

Turner        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 10 - December  2010  In addition to his administrative duties, the Chief Commissioner (or his  delegate) also acts as the County’s Director of Emergency Management. He is  supported in this role by the Fire Chief, who acts as Deputy Director, Emergency  Management.  The County’s Emergency Management Plan is composed of an  overarching “Coordinating Plan” (which outlines in general terms each  Department’s area of responsibility) and individual Department plans. The overall  plan is administered and maintained by SCES, however, each department is  responsible for the composition and maintenance of their portion of the  document. The plan is deemed confidential due to the amount of personal  information contained therein, and access to the whole is limited to Executive  Team, County Managers and Coordinators.   The following overview of the history and organization of Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES), which includes other issues impacting the  department at the time, provides an additional framework for the observations  and findings contained in the remainder of this After Action Report.     2. Strathcona County Emergency Services (SCES)  SCES was first established as a  volunteer fire brigade in November  1956, operating out of a member’s  private garage with a donated half-ton  truck and some fire fighting equipment.  At the time, incidents were reported by  a telephone operator who would  individually phone each volunteer with  muster instructions. If the call came  during the day when the men were at  work, their wives would respond in their  place (Harrington, 1983).   Much has changed since then. Today, SCES is a combination of full time  (career) and part time (on call) fire fighters working in a fully integrated municipal  fire / rescue / emergency medical services (EMS) department.  SCES career  members are Fire Fighter  or Fire Fighter  Medical  Technicians (EMTs), fully trained in both disciplines. Fire, rescue and EMS all  operate out of three full time fire stations, providing a complete range of  emergency services to Strathcona County. In addition to the full time stations,  Strathcona County volunteer fire fighters  circa 1959.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 11 - December  2010  SCES also operates two rural part time stations, manned by on-call first  responders. In November 2006, the department celebrated fifty years of  exemplary community service and in May 2009, had a complement of over 200  full and part time staff responding out of five stations located throughout the  County.  Its professed mission:   With integrity and courage, through focus and commitment, Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES) will:   Protect the health and safety of our fire fighters, emergency  responders and the public   Lessen pain and suffering and preserve quality of life   Protect the environment   Protect property   Deliver superior emergency situation management   Promote safety awareness through public education   Maintain public confidence   (Strathcona County Emergency Services, 2010)  The department’s professed vision is to be the innovative leader in the  provision of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Medical Services. This reflects the  department’s learning ideology; while it operates as a paramilitary organization  with strict command hierarchy, it also incorporates a seamless team environment  (i.e. all members are fully cross trained within each Division to sustain an efficient  flow of operations). Knowledge sharing is strongly encouraged, as is the  continuing educational and professional development of each and every  employee. Historical analysis proves this has always been a vital key to the  department’s growth, as evidenced in the following excerpt from a local  compilation, Sherwood Park, the First Twenty-five Years:   The credibility of the department has always been high. The  early emphasis on training and fire prevention, as well as on  fighting fires, may well have contributed significantly to the  high level of citizen and local government support enjoyed  by the department (Harrington, 1983, p. 67).   In 1995, SCES followed its goal of innovative leadership by piloting a  provincial 911 project through Telus and subsequently becoming the first official  provincial Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). It was also the first Emergency  Communications Centre in Canada to be registered with the International      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 12 - December  2010  Standards Organization (ISO)4. SCES has subsequently added EMS, Rescue  and fire to its ISO 9001 certification.  In 2009, in addition to Strathcona County,  SCES was providing 911 call answer and  dispatch services to over 100  neighboring municipalities (equating to a population of approximately 500,000  Alberta residents) and fielded in excess of 60,000 E911 calls that year.   As a response to increased expectations and calls for service from several  stakeholders, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), large  industrial organizations such as oil refineries and upgraders and municipal  mutual aid partners, SCES has in recent years also developed several specialty  teams.  These include a Technical Rescue Team (TRT), Water  Rescue Team   and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services.    For further details on SCES organization as it appeared in 2009, please  see Appendix 4.   2.1 The SCES Management Team  Due to recent retirements, the entire  management team (Chief and Deputy Chiefs)  of SCES has been replaced over the  previous four years. At the time of the first  retirement in 2005, the management team  had an average of approximately eighteen  years of Chief Officer or Senior Manager  experience, with an average age of  approximately 54.  In 2009, the Management  Team had an average of less than three  years of Chief Officer or Senior Manager  experience and an average age of 39. While  the incumbent Fire Chief had a total tenure of  seventeen years with SCES, none of the  Deputy Chiefs had longer than eight years of  service with the department, with one of the  Deputies having a military background, one  having a mixed municipal and industrial fire background, and one having a mixed   industrial emergency, disaster management and law enforcement background.                                                                4 “ISO certification is the basis of performance measurement throughout Europe and most other  industrialized countries” and “applies to both the design and provision” of services so registered   (SCES, 2009a).                                    Darrell Reid, Manager  Chief  Strathcona County Emergency Services  Deputy Director,  Emergency Management        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 13 - December  2010  Although the previous administration had a greater depth of emergency  services training and experience, comparison of the past and present  management team yielded some differences in education levels.  Five years ago,  no Chief Officers at SCES had a university degree of any kind; in 2009, the Fire  Chief and one Deputy Fire Chief have graduate degrees in business  administration, a second Deputy Chief has an applied degree in business and the  third Deputy Chief is certified as a Canadian Emergency Manager (CEM) and  business continuity professional.  The Fire Chief and two Deputy Chiefs are also  registered paramedics, equaling three years of post-secondary education in  Alberta.  Many organizational and human resource outcomes were potentially  affected by the changes to the leadership of SCES, including morale, staff  perception of leadership within the organization, staff perception of working  conditions and environment, attraction and retention of staff, job security,  succession planning, service delivery quality, and reputation of SCES (Reid,  2009, p.10-12).   2.2 Other Considerations  On April 1, 2009, in conjunction  with the Alberta Government’s transition  of EMS funding and governance, SCES  entered into contract with Alberta Health  Services (AHS) to continue to provide  EMS service to Strathcona County and  the region. In addition to provision of  ambulance services, SCES expanded its  Emergency Communications Centre in  2009 and entered into an agreement  with AHS to assist with the transition of  EMS dispatch into late 2010.  Under the terms of the AHS agreement, SCES is required to ensure four  ambulances are always available for borderless regional coverage.  Balancing  incident resource requirements with contractual obligations during the height of  the wildfire proved challenging to all involved. In addition, SCES was also  obligated to respond to other incidents occurring within the municipality  simultaneous to the 2009 North Strathcona Fire. There was one occurrence in  particular where SCES was required to mitigate a second wildland fire in the  southern area of the County during this same time frame.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 14 - December  2010  Section B: Prevention Measures   This section looks at prevention measures and policies encouraged or  enforced in Strathcona in an effort to prevent and  mitigate the effects of  wildfire on County lands and populations.        1. FireSmart:    Wildfires are a constituent of nature in forest, grassland, or even wetlands.   The issue some communities currently face is that human activity has increased  near and in natural areas over the last century, producing the Wildland   Interface (WUI).  The fuel load found in these areas can burn at incredible rates  and temperatures, causing inconceivable damage.  In some areas where a fire  has not burned for many years, this fuel load can be ignited by the smallest of  sources. This increases the risk of fires starting due to human activity and the  risk of structures being lost to fire damage.  According to Partners in   Protection (2010)5:   In the interface, successful fire protection cannot rely solely on  maintaining good fire control capability. To be successful, interface  stakeholders must implement a combination of appropriate  activities to raise awareness, reduce hazards, and plan for fire  occurrences (p.5).  To address this need, Partners in Protection has developed the FireSmart  Program, which provides valuable information to homeowners on ways to reduce  the impact of wildfire. By taking several preventative steps, residents can help  minimize potential damage to their property.   1.1 Observations  Although Strathcona County Emergency Services (SCES) did promote the  FireSmart program before the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, such promotions were  limited.  FireSmart brochures were offered to each Strathcona County resident  who applied for a fire permit, pamphlets were handed out at public events and  information on the program was made available through the County website.                                                               5 Partners in Protection is an Alberta-based coalition of multi-disciplinary professionals committed to  raising awareness [and] providing information… and practical tools for building FireSmart communities  (http:/ .partnersinprotection.ab.ca).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 15 - December  2010  1.2 Findings  The potential value of the FireSmart program became sharply evident  during the 2009 fire, when fire fighters faced the challenge of protecting “non- FireSmart” homes. In 2010, in addition to handing out the FireSmart brochures  and providing information on the web, SCES held three community information  sessions. These sessions took place in April, 2010 in the communities of  Ardrossan, Josephburg and South Cooking Lake.       2. Fire Bans and Outdoor Burning Controls   Outdoor burning in Strathcona  County is governed by the Emergency  Services Bylaw 68-2000, which  “establishes and provides for the  efficient operation of a fire and  ambulance service in Strathcona  County”. It also regulates the “issuance  of fire permits, reporting of property  damaged by fire, control of fire hazards,  open fires, incinerator fires, pit fires,                          Signs purchased by SCES to assist in timely  communication efforts with residents and visitors.   1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned:   FireSmart homes are more easily protected, thus reducing both  property and fire fighting costs.    Petroleum sites were at risk, but proper clearing using techniques  similar to FireSmart (i.e. set back requirements and industry  practices for environmental protection, emergency evacuation and  flaring) minimized damage to these facilities.  All natural and utility  resource corporations are commended on their quick actions in  isolating gas and oil sources within the burn areas, which greatly  minimized the hazard   Stronger promotion of programs such as FireSmart in the various  Strathcona County communities has the potential to exponentially  reduce the impact of wildfire.         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 16 - December  2010  smudge fires and types of materials burned” (Strathcona County, 2010).  Fire  permits, which are required for any open or incinerator fires, can be obtained for  use on rural properties only, and are valid from date of approval to the end of  each calendar year. Prior to lighting any fire for which a permit is needed, the  permit-holder is required to call Emergency Service's 24-hour automated burning  information line as well as the wind speed line (as noted and provided on the  permit) to confirm that conditions allow for safe burning.   2.1 Observations  Prior to 2009, there was no formal standard established to determine  conditions under which fire hazards are assessed, evaluated and controlled in  Strathcona County.  Burning conditions were assessed and evaluated through an  estimated “best guess” of three different factors: wind speed, dryness and  availability of fire fighting resources. Control consisted of a recording on the  automated line that advised that burning either was or was not allowed at that  particular point in time.  Enforcement of controls was heavily dependent on a  “neighborhood watch” system; residents were urged to report any “improper”  burning to 911. Furthermore, although Bylaw 68-2000 authorized the issuance of  fines for contravention of permit regulations, SCES personnel preferred to view  any response to reports of improper burning as educational opportunities. In fact,  prior to 2008, the few fines that were issued were nominal and given out only at  the Fire Marshal’s discretion. The past two years, however, have seen a gradual  increase in both the number of fines issued and the amount assessed (which can  be as much as $1,000), sending a clear message to residents of a decreased  tolerance for permit infractions.  The authority to issue a full Fire Ban or suspend burning privileges is  derived through the Forest and Prairie Protection Act (RSA 2000, Chapter F-19,  Articles 4(3), 6(d), 7(1), 21 and 27). Beyond specifying how often and by what  means fire bans must be communicated to the public, however, the Act provides  little to no guidance on when, if, or how such authority should be invoked.  Due to  the labour intensive and costly protocols involved in instituting and  revoking a  full fire ban6, SCES officials have been reluctant in the past to go to such lengths,  relying instead on the burning information line to inform residents of high fire risk  periods. In fact, prior to the summer of 2008, the last full fire ban for Strathcona  County had been issued in the summer of 2002 despite the increasing fire risk  caused by the intervening six years of near-drought conditions.                                                                6 i.e. obtaining, setting up and taking down of numerous portable highway signs; preparing and issuing  approved media releases and public announcements; changing pre-recorded messages; etc.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 17 - December  2010  Since the initial north Strathcona fire occurred in May of 2008, SCES has  been far less reluctant to institute burning restrictions. In sharp contrast to past  practice, a total of four full fire bans were issued for Strathcona County in the one  year period between May 2009 and 2010.  2.2 Findings:  Although research into standardized protocols for the issuance of fire bans  had been conducted prior to 2008, factors such as managerial and staff turnover,  coupled with drastic department growth and other considerations (i.e. the  provincial ambulance transfer) caused this research to be overlooked and  relegated the implementation of such standards to a lesser priority.   In 2009, however, new research into standardized protocols was  undertaken.  This research, combined with a review of issues encountered in  issuing and revoking the fire ban the previous year, resulted in the creation of an  empirical fire ban matrix and standard protocols which were in place by April  2010 (Please see Appendix 5 for the complete SCES fire ban matrix).  While there is no evidence to suggest that issuance of a full fire ban may  have prevented the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, it could be argued that SCES  would have been quicker to institute such controls if streamlined procedures and  clear protocols had previously been established. Issuance of a fire ban would, at  the very least, have resulted in increased awareness among residents of the  extreme fire risk, and possibly have reduced recreational use of the affected area  at the time.  These claims can be supported by the speed with which SCES instituted a  second fire ban from September 24 to October 7, 2009, and the ease with which  Strathcona visitors and residents understood, accepted and complied.  It is also  not unreasonable to suggest that the increased number of “illegal fires” reported  to 911, as well as an increase in enquiries received by both 2117 and SCES  Administration on the subject of fire bans, fines and fire permits during this  period, reflected an increased awareness of burning control regulations among  Strathcona County residents and visitors.   It is interesting to note that SCES was very quick to issue full fire bans in  2010 (first in April and again in May), after these refined standards and protocols                                                              7 211 is [a 24 hour] easy to remember telephone number that connects people to a full range of non- emergency social, health, and government services in the community   (http:/ .com  .php).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 18 - December  2010  were put into place. Of even more interest is the fact that, after experiencing  wildland fires of increasing magnitude for two years in a row, and despite  increased levels of fire risk, the north Strathcona area remained “fire-free”   in 2010.       2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   A number of factors can play a role in determining when a   fire ban is declared, including:    levels of both recent and total precipitation;    the risk of a fire getting out of control;    relation between temperature and humidity;    water restrictions or water bans; and     appropriate staffing and equipment availability   A Strathcona County Fire Ban Matrix has been developed to  incorporate all above considerations and provide a consistent,  evidence-based method of determining when a full fire ban   should be put into place.   A Standard Operating Policy (SOP) has been developed and  adopted by SCES which clearly outlines procedures and   protocols to implement burning control measures in Strathcona  County. These protocols have greatly reduced the ambiguity   and costs associated with invoking and revoking a full fire ban.     Erring on the side of caution and invoking a full fire ban sooner  rather than later raises awareness of fire risk and burning  regulations among residents, businesses and visitors of  Strathcona County. This in turn promotes community   participation in reduced fire hazards.           2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 19 - December  2010  Section C: Field Operations  Section C investigates all aspects of the response effort in the field during  the course of the wildfire, including the aspect of Emergency Social Services  (ESS) provided to evacuees. Data for this section was gathered through a review  of all SCES records relating to the incident, including dispatch transcripts, officer  narratives, reports from debriefings conducted with Mutual Aid, outside agencies  and other departments, as well as anecdotal accounts from various County  personnel.       1. Fire Suppression Efforts   On the afternoon of May 3, 2009 at 2:45 p.m. SCES crews were  dispatched to Township Road (TWP) 562 and west of Range Road (RR) 212 for  an outside fire.  Captain Nicholson, the initial officer on scene, reported two  distinct fires located on the east and west sides of Highway (Hwy) 830  discharging large columns of grey  smoke.    1.1 Observations:   Captain Nicholson and initial crews immediately began protecting  structures threatened on the east side of Hwy 830, north of TWP 564, and  established a staging area at the entry to Shiloh Ranch8.  Platoon Chief (PC)  Nixon was the next commanding officer on scene and directly began attacking  the wildland fire located on the West side of Hwy 830 in the area of RR 212 and  TWP 564.  At this point there were approximately 35 fire fighters from SCES  operating on the two fires.   On both sides of the highway, the fires  were supplied with extremely dry conditions and  relatively high winds. Mutual Aid Resources  were immediately requested, with Fire  Departments from Andrew, Edmonton, Dow  Chemicals, Shell Scotford, Fort Saskatchewan,  and Beaver County responding units to assist.   Bruderheim and Lamont County were not  available as they were managing a portion of  the East fire in their areas.                                                              8 Shiloh Ranch is a private youth ranch for disadvantaged children, run on a not-for-profit basis.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 20 - December  2010   Deputy Chiefs (DC) Jones and Elliott arrived on scene at approximately  4:00 p.m. as the requirement to escalate the response was apparent.  DC Jones  assumed command of the East incident, PC Nixon assumed command of the  West incident and DC Elliott assumed area command, supporting both incidents.   Concurrently, Fire Chief Darrell Reid was establishing the Department  Operations Centre (DOC) at Fire Station #1 and activating the Emergency  Operations Centre (EOC) in County Hall.  The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was also dispatched to the area at this time to provide  further command capability.   RCMP and fire resources commenced with a voluntary evacuation of  threatened residents, livestock and visitors to the Bruderheim Natural area, a  popular motorized recreation vehicle spot.  Although effective evacuation was  achieved for acreage residents in the first few hours, there were challenges in  removing recreation vehicle operators from the scene.  There were also certain  challenges in assisting agricultural residents with evacuation of livestock. Further  details on the Emergency Social Services (ESS) aspect of the response are  contained in segment 2 of this section.   Concurrently, the utilities and energy  companies who operate pipelines, power  lines, and petroleum sites  in the area  were contacted to provide expertise in  isolating risks from these hazards.  The  Salvation Army was also dispatched to  ensure evacuated residents were cared for,  and to provide meals for emergency  responders.   Fire suppression efforts utilized by fire fighters and officers were basic  wildland  interface controls, using water to wet down fire areas, manual  labor to excavate ground fires, and structure protection measures.  These efforts  proved rather effective, but very labor intensive for the duration of the day and  early evening operations on May 3.  At 22:20 hrs, the work completed on both  fires over the previous seven hours was beginning to prove successful.  Crews  were able to regroup and overhaul was initiated on both fires.  The EOC was  discontinued and by 01:00 hrs on May 4, most mutual aid resources had been  released.  Area command was assigned to Platoon Chief (PC) Sutton, west  command consisted of two brush trucks and one tanker unit doing roving patrols      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 21 - December  2010  for overhaul, and the east command consisted of one squad, one tanker, and  one brush truck also doing roving patrols for overhaul.    Unfortunately, the early morning of  May 4 produced winds gusting to 50 km   from the west, which started large flare ups  as the fire was pushed into high fuel loads.   At 03:00 hrs the west fire was deemed out  of control in several areas due to the fact  that crews were finding it difficult to travel  in the wildland areas in darkness.     At dawn the high winds and  temperature hindered firefighting efforts and both fires flared up again.  The main  issue with fire growth was structure protection as more buildings were being  threatened.  The majority of the effort on May 4 was spent in trying to protect  homes, secure heavy equipment such as bulldozers with operators for building  effective fire breaks and organizing command with multiple public and private  agencies.  Provincial Sustainable Resources Development (SRD), Forestry  Division, was able to immediately provide three air tanker groups that could drop  a total of over 40,000 liters of fire retardant.   Even though this air support found  operations difficult due to the size of the  fire, there was some reprieve observed.  In  addition to the air support, Alberta SRD  approved a request from both Lamont and  Strathcona County to provide ground  support and approximately 90 SRD and  SRD contract employees were deployed to  Heartland Hall (Fire Station #4).   May 5 maintained similar weather patterns with ever changing gusting  winds and increased temperature with decreased humidity.  After 48 hours of  extraordinary fire growth and even greater fire suppression efforts, 130 fire  fighters, two air tanker groups, three bulldozer groups with three bulldozers per  group, and a number of mutual aid resources were still working on restricting fire  movement and protecting structures.     Although Mutual Aid Partners were released by the end of the first week,  SCES fire fighters, Contractors and SRD crews continued to battle the wildfire  over the next two months with varying success.  By the end of May, total fire      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 22 - December  2010  costs were estimated to be in excess of  $834,000.  Factors unrelated to the actual  response also hindered their efforts.  Interference from ATV operators in the  area increased to a level that forced SRD  crews to relocate their base of operations.  At this point, SCES closed the area to all  non-essential traffic and recreational use.  This restriction remained in effect until the  incident was deemed officially over.     During the last week of May, SRD crews began a formal demobilization,  but maintained a presence at the scene, operating from their temporary base  located near Station #4, Heartland Hall.  Throughout the month of June, both  SRD and SCES crews continued to search out and deal with troublesome  hotspots. These patrols continued until the 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire was  officially declared extinguished on Friday, July 3, nearly ten weeks after the initial  call to 911.    For a detailed timeline of this incident, please see Appendix 6.    1.2 Findings:  a) Command and Coordination   Command coordination was in place for the first 72 hours, but challenges  with control were lacking in several areas.  The scope of the incident required a  larger command structure than typically utilized by SCES.  Area Command was  established at the onset with two separate commands reporting for day one;  however, there was some confusion on this organization of command in the  subordinate levels reporting to the separate East and West commands.      This was rectified at the start of day two, with Area Command and two  subordinate geographic commands being abolished and replaced by a single  Command, Operations Section and Divisions  being established as  necessary. On day three, command became unified with SRD with Deputy  Section Chiefs established as required.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 23 - December  2010  As stated, control over outside agencies was lacking. Having mutual aid  resources available was a definite benefit, but the size and intensity of the  wildfire coupled with challenges in communication produced a risk for these  resources.     Self-deployed resources were also a definite issue.  Research has shown  that this type of “emergent activity” is common in disaster situations.  Invariably,  there is a convergence of resources into the affected community, a “‘mass  assault’ of independent and decentralized activity” (Perry, 1991, p.202; Wenger,  1992, p.3; Scawthorn and Wenger, 1990, p2-3; Auf der Heide, 1989, p.75;  Wenger et.al., 1987, p.20 as cited in Drabek & McEntire, 2003, p.100). Often,  “groups … emerge to begin automatically responding to the needs of one  another” without official sanction (Fischer, 2002, p.124). During times of  community crisis, self-deployed or “emergent groups” represent “a potential  source of knowledge, funds, equipment, and human resources” that may be  critical to response or recovery efforts (Wachtendorf, 2001, p.11). On the other  hand, as they commonly operate independent of traditional authority, such  groups also have the potential of further disrupting response efforts that may  already be strained (Fowler, 2008, p.1).  One particular instance during the  2009 North Strathcona Fire supports this  claim. A private corporation took the initiative  to provide assistance that was not officially  sanctioned. Although this company provides  an excellent service, it does so at an elevated  cost. In addition to escalated costs, because  this company did not coordinate its efforts  through area command, they not only created  a potential duplication of effort, they also lacked access to information that could  have been critical to the safety of their own resources. In other words, by not  placing themselves under the established unified command, they became  another “uncontrollable element in the response milieu whose appearance …  [created] complications for security and site safety” (Kendra & Wachtendorf,  2002, p.138).   b) Communications   Communications, always an issue in emergent situations, presented  several challenges during this incident. These challenges, however, helped to not      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 24 - December  2010  only identify some important deficiencies within SCES’ current radio system, but  also identify possible solutions through a unique opportunity to test new  technology introduced through the collaboration of two of its vendors.     In the past, radio communication to the northern area of Strathcona  County has consistently proven ineffective, due mainly to the height and  coverage of the radio tower in the Heartland area.  A new radio system had been  purchased and put into operations approximately one year prior, which greatly  reduced this deficiency; however, it was still being dealt with at the time the 2009  North fire occurred.    During this time frame, SCES, in partnership with Westcan  Communication Services and Motorola, was conducting the first-in-the-world test  of 4.9 Ghz technology.  The 2009 North Strathcona Fire provided the unexpected  opportunity to field-test newly-developed bridging radio technology used as part  of the trial. The bridge provides the user with the ability to “link” two different  radio systems, giving the separate users the ability to speak with one another  using their own radio equipment. There were challenges using a new system “on  the fly”, but it did display some promise for future operations. In addition to the  bridging technology, Westcan provided emergency radio assistance, portable  towers and radio-coverage monitoring and service.  Another communication challenge involved mutual aid and external auto- deployed resources. With a finite number of SCES radios and personnel, it was  difficult to assign either to external parties.  At times, mutual aid resources were  held back because SCES Command had no method of communicating with  them. Although cell phones filled this gap to a certain extent, this solution was far  from ideal. A more effective solution was demonstrated in the deployment of an  Edmonton Fire Battalion Chief to the SCES Incident Command Post (ICP).  During the first 24 hours, this officer became the main point of communication  between the Edmonton contingent and the area commander, promoting a swift  and seamless transfer of crucial information between the two parties.  c) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources  Re-evaluation of fuel packets did occur at regular intervals with crews and  resources requested and assigned as needed to protect the various well-heads  and properties in the area. A more efficient use of mutual aid resources,  however, could have been instituted.  Requests for mutual aid assistance were  “bunched” too closely together and as a result, resources were not evenly  available or dispersed across operational periods.  In fact, at times, it was      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 25 - December  2010  discovered that mutual aid resources had been deemed surplus and released, as  opposed to being staged and ready, just as the situation changed and the need  for these resources became apparent.   Accountability for tracking team members was also problematic; it was not  always maintained and teams did not always preserve group cohesion. This  accountability issue was further confounded among external teams by  unfamiliarity, not only with department-specific terminology but also with local  geography. These challenges were alleviated to some degree by the use of the  Incident Command System (ICS) and the inclusion of the Edmonton Fire  Battalion Chief in incident command as mentioned previously in this section.    In fact, this suggests a solution that  could have been easily expanded to  integrate all mutual aid and county  resources: divide field staff into “joint”  teams; for example, group two SCES  personnel with two mutual aid personnel.  This not only addresses communication  issues by providing each team with  compatible radio technologies and  common terminology, it also addresses  geographical concerns. Furthermore, it ensures a “vested” interest within each  team. Perhaps most importantly of all, however, such blended crews represent  an increased ability to meet obligations with regard to crew safety.    d) Safety and Accountability  To address issues noted above, a system of tracking resources and their  location was developed and implemented within the first 72 hours.  Based on ICS  principles, this system provided a consistent daily overview of who was on duty,  what roles or functions were assigned and  performed and any safety issues  encountered.   SCES also employed its traditional  system of tracking employees using  accountability tags attached to a “board”.  These tags are assigned to each member at  the commencement of their career with  SCES, a system used in many departments  throughout North America. Although this      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 26 - December  2010  system has proven efficient in smaller events, its use on a significant incident  with multiple fronts proved far more challenging. As well, the accountability of  external resources was identified as being less than adequate   at times.   Safety and accountability was a particular issue in the first two days of the  event.  Crews were worked extremely hard for extended hours with little to no  rehabilitation scheduled. Crews that initially responded to the incident had been  on duty since 06:00 hrs that morning, but were held by necessity on the  fireground until approximately 23:00 hrs that night. Not only did this increase the  risk of error or injury, it also revealed a serious flaw in the planning process; a  reactive rather than proactive mentality which gave little thought towards what  resources SCES had in reserve for the future or left in place for day to day  operations. SCES’ human resource profile at the onset of the incident was lean.  Fire officers and fire fighters faced an ever changing event with an ever changing  roster of part time fire fighters, mutual aid and external, auto-deployed resources.  In fact, at one point, staffing pressures caused recruits still in their orientation  period to be called into active duty. Although Occupational Health and Safety  (OHS) Codes require such members to be under the direct supervision of a  competent worker, this was not always the case.     SCES, however, prides itself on the direction of safety in the station and  on the fireground.  Within the first 24 hours of this event, the issue of time and  resource management was brought forward and addressed.  Over the next two  days, one person was assigned the duty of better organizing personnel.  Consistent, scheduled shifts of eight to ten hours were established for fire  fighters on an overtime basis to ensure regular shifts were not impacted. At the  onset, the shifts consisted of eight to twelve fire fighters with officers; as the  event decelerated, shifts of two to six fire fighters were established.  This proved  useful as the mode turned to the overhaul stage.  Fire fighters were able to  respond to smaller incidents in the region while SRD provided support for  ongoing wildland firefighting in the north.    Personnel Accountability Report (PAR) checks were also completed at  every shift, however, this was done on a sporadic basis at best; units and groups  were largely left to their own devices.  Although a rudimentary sign-in procedure  was used at the Incident Command Post (ICP) in an attempt to track mutual aid  and private resources, a more formalized process would definitely have enabled  more efficient coordination and accountability of resources. Daily Safe Work  Plans, establishing pertinent hazards, controls and procedures to mitigate      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 27 - December  2010  hazards and risk also provide better risk management for larger events of longer  duration. This is a common SRD practice that has since been adopted by SCES.     Fortunately, only two relatively minor injuries were reported during the  entire event, and both involved external personnel.  This is an important statistic,  considering that the size and scope of this event was beyond anything the  department had encountered in the past.    e) Incident Command System (ICS) Utilization    Although, as mentioned previously, ICS principles were employed to track  accountability and safety, the ICS hierarchical structure, itself, was not developed  at a pace appropriate to incident progression. Several vital roles were not filled  until serious issues were encountered.  A delay in appointing Staging and  Logistics Officers, for example, caused a delay in the establishment of a staging  area distinct and separate from the camp area set aside for food, rest and  maintenance breaks. This created several points of confusion. Arriving resources  had no clear reporting point and had difficulty checking in. Staged resources  mingled with those out of service and were then not readily available for  deployment. Having Staging and Logistics Officers in place immediately ensures  an early ability to track and move the right resources to the right place at the right  time. Moreover, through the early establishment of separate, distinct and  supervised staging and camp areas, these resources are usually physically  located where they are expected to be.    Another ICS role that would have  dramatically increased operational  efficiency is the Officer “Scribe”.  Scribes  can greatly facilitate information transfer  and buffer their officers from unnecessary  interruption. More importantly, they  enable a thoroughly detailed and accurate  incident progression record for later  analysis and cost recovery applications.       f) Logistics  Apart from issues noted in previous sections, the major logistical  challenges faced in this incident dealt either with food and water provision for  responders and evacuees, or identification and management of vendors and  contractors for required resources.   Location of command post, day 1.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 28 - December  2010  In order to meet the obligation of ensuring adequate provision for  evacuees and responders, SCES called in the Salvation Army to provide food  support from the initial onset throughout the first month of the incident, with some  assistance from Shell Scotford’s catering service. As the event proceeded, a  number of helpful residents also sought to assist in this regard, but with  questionable results.  As in any situation where food is provided on a  “commercial” or “public” basis, it is crucial to ensure that the providers meet  Alberta Health Requirements.  This is generally done through a rigorous  inspection of the preparation process, which is not always possible when food is  prepared off-site or in non-professional kitchens.  For this reason, food offerings  were not always received in the spirit in which they were given.  In fact, in one  particular instance, a complaint was made that SCES fire fighters had refused or  thrown food away, untouched, in front of the donors who had brought it. The  complaint was investigated, but due to a lack of recorded evidence, it was  impossible to determine the exact details. Fortunately, this appears to have been  an isolated episode, but nevertheless, SCES personnel were instructed to be  more circumspect in future.   In addition to issues revolving around food preparation, there were also  challenges with how it was distributed and to whom.  To address hygiene issues  in the field, handwash stations at eating or catering areas could have ensured  decreased cross contamination. With regard to distribution issues, a system of  meal tickets (with accompanying instructions on where and how to use them)  could have provided better controls on actual food consumption.  A second major logistical challenge  dealt with the identification and  management of vendors and contractors for  other required resources, such as bull  dozers and sanitation equipment (porta  potties).  It was sometimes difficult to  differentiate between officially contracted  and “emergent” (self-deployed) resources.   Required information, such as Occupational  Health and Safety (OHS) and Worker Compensation Board (WCB) compliance,  or details on billing and service agreements, was not always provided.  As well,  verification and  tracking of actual services rendered proved lacking at times.   Several solutions for these issues were suggested during the debriefing  sessions.  One of the most practical was the creation of a “Pre-approved Vendor  List”, a list of contractors and vendors who have agreed to provide necessary      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 29 - December  2010  resources at a pre-negotiated price during emergency events.  This would ensure  provision of resources that are properly trained and compatible within the  guidelines of SCES operations as well as a full understanding of vendor  processes and expectations before the contracted work is undertaken.   In addition to the Approved Vendor list, a proper check-in  system,  such as a time clock, could ensure proper tracking controls are in place. An  official system of identification, such as magnetic door logos for official contractor  vehicles, is also needed to clearly differentiate them from self-deployed  resources.  These solutions not only address the need for timely provision of  appropriate resources and responsible financial oversight, but also increase site  safety and security.     g) Situational Awareness   Initial size-up and strategies involved in dealing with two concurrent  wildfires was difficult with limited human resources.  As well, the sheer size of the  area, coupled with topographical features such as heavy brush and limited sight- lines, impeded the rapid collection of accurate and comprehensive intelligence at  ground level.  These difficulties were quickly resolved once aerial  reconnaissance had been obtained and Strathcona County’s Geographic  Information Systems (GIS) Department began plotting the data onto meaningful  and detailed maps.    h) Planning and Training    Deficiencies and challenges were also noted in the areas of planning and  training.  One major deficiency lay in the fact that although the SCES portion of  the County’s Emergency Response Plan was up to date in electronic draft  format, this information had not yet been made official or shared with key  personnel in hard copy format as per normal process. As a result, the plan was  found lacking when put into play and valuable time was wasted in re-gathering  crucial information.     This deficiency is a common issue in emergency management. Although  research suggests more emphasis should be placed on the planning process  than the plan, itself (Wachtendorf and Kendra, 2006), this does not always  happen. It can be difficult for staff facing other work demands, to justify spending  the necessary time preparing and planning for something that may never happen  (Fowler, 2008).  To address this issue, SCES piloted a Strathcona County  Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) in January 2010, whose mandate      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 30 - December  2010  and focus is to redesign and improve the County’s existing emergency  management and business continuity plans and processes.     Also related to a planning deficiency was the fact that SCES did not have  personnel with Dozer Boss Training for constructing proper dozer (fire) guards.  This is a tactic strongly recommended and used by SRD.  Having properly  trained staff right at the outset can drastically and immediately restrict fire  extension.  Not having this capability for the first two days severely limited SCES’  ability to complete an early, efficient strategic fire containment.  Since this  incident, Strathcona County has trained and certified six Strathcona County  employees in proper dozer guard construction tactics.    1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Utilizing water and basic manual labor for protection of structures  was appropriate, but proved ineffective for restricting fire growth in  large wildland  fires. Early acquisition of heavy equipment with  trained operators for constructing proper fire breaks would provide  increased efficiency in fire suppression efforts.     Smooth communication with and integration of mutual aid resources  proved challenging. The standard and consistent use of “blended”  crews could not only address communication and safety issues, but  also ensure the existence of a “vested” interest in all fire fighting  teams.    Control and coordination of self deployed resources (emergent  activity or groups) can also become a challenge in large incidents.    A consistent system and process, such as a pre-approved vendor  list, can facilitate identification and  coordination of unauthorized  activity into the authorized response.    A pre-approved vendor list and contracting system for heavy  equipment also ensures provision of resources that are properly  trained and compatible within the guidelines of SCES operations   and prior full understanding of vendor processes and expectations.    OHS obligations require that recruits who have not completed their  orientation period be under the direct supervision of a competent  worker at all times. Such supervision, however, may not always be  feasible. Where resource needs require the deployment of such  inexperienced recruits, their roles should be limited to those which  do not put them at risk (i.e. aide  duties, logistical support,  rehabilitation or medical monitoring).  continued next page      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 31 - December  2010    1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned (cont’d)   Fire crews working extended hours with little to no scheduled  rehabilitation increases the risk of error or injury.  Food provision   and rest break coordination must be considered a critical aspect   of incident planning.   The Incident Command System (ICS) is “a proven management  system based on successful business practices and is the result of  decades of lessons learned in the organization and management   of emergency incidents” (City of Edmonton Office of Emergency  Preparedness, 2009, p.9). Building the “bench strength” of  Strathcona County within ICS would ensure ICS is used to full   extent and that its hierarchical structure is developed at a pace  appropriate to incident progression.   Initial size up and strategies involved in dealing with two concurrent  fires was difficult with limited human resources.  The acquisition of  air support during initial onset can provide rapid, accurate and  comprehensive intelligence gathering. This facilitates the early  development of effective incident action plans and swifter  implementation of appropriate strategy and tactics.     Basic mapping of wildland areas should be employed from the  onset of the event.  Strathcona County has an extremely robust  GIS department that is very competent in providing excellent maps  with great detail and information.   The lack of officers assigned to Planning and Logistics roles at the  scene from initial onset caused delay in mitigation actions.  Having  these roles assigned early relieves the pressure on the Incident  Commander, allowing him to focus on long term strategy rather  than immediate tactics and provides for better situational  awareness.    Although more emphasis should be placed on the planning  process, it can be difficult for staff facing other work demands to  justify spending the necessary time. To address this issue, SCES  has created the Strathcona County Emergency Management  Agency (SCEMA) pilot project, whose focus is to redesign and  improve the County’s existing emergency management process.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 32 - December  2010  2. Emergency Social Services (ESS)  Information for the following segment was provided by Family and  Community Services (FCS) Department through a review of their records,  debriefs and anecdotal accounts.    2.1 Observations  To provide for residents and visitors responding to the voluntary  evacuation of the area called for on the afternoon of May 3, a Reception Centre  was opened at the Moyer Recreation Centre in Josephberg around 19:00 hours  that same evening. The role of Reception Centre Manager was initially filled by  Emergency Services personnel, although an FCS Coordinator and Supervisor  were immediately dispatched to the facility. Upon arrival, the two FCS staff  assisted the SCES Captain, Fire Prevention & Investigation and the SCES Public  Safety Education & Marketing Specialist in preparing the Reception Centre to  receive evacuees.   Volunteer resources from the Salvation Army were already at work  preparing food in anticipation of potential demand9. These volunteers operated  independently in a self-contained unit, but remained under the direction of the  Reception Centre Manager. RCMP Victim Services volunteers also arrived at   the Moyer Centre later that evening to assist with supportive counseling   for evacuees.   On May 4, following a clarification of roles, FCS staff assumed the role of  Reception Centre Manager, leaving SCES personnel to deal with any media who  might arrive at the Centre. Victim Services volunteers were directed to act as  liaison between any evacuees wanting to return to their homes and the RCMP  who could escort them there. When the Centre was open to the public, a  Recreation Parks and Culture (RPC) staff member was always present to assist  with access issues and answer questions pertaining to facility details.  FCS staff  members worked in two to four member teams, depending on the time of day; a  total of six different FCS staff participated throughout the course of the event.    From May 4th to May 9th (when the EOC was also stood down), the  Reception Centre was opened on a daily basis between 09:00 hours and 19:00 /  20:00 hours, when direction to close was received from the EOC. Contact was  maintained between the Reception Centre and the ESS Manager in the EOC via  cell phone.                                                               9The food was later redeployed to the incident staging area when evacuees failed to materialize.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 33 - December  2010  During this time period, only two evacuees registered at the Centre, and  neither chose to remain.  Other visitors included the Elected Official for the area,  the Community Liaison Officer and a health inspector who arrived on the second  day to examine the kitchen facilities and discuss food distribution with Reception  Centre staff.  Media also came to the site on three separate occasions asking to  speak with evacuees.    2.2 Findings  The authority to call for an evacuation (on either a voluntary or mandatory  basis) during a declared State of Local Emergency is derived through the  Emergency Management Act (RSA 2000, Chapter E-6.8, Article 19 [1, g]). Along  with this authority, however, comes a responsibility to “make arrangements for  the adequate care and protection of those persons or livestock …” (p.13).     The establishment of the Reception Centre addressed this obligation;  however, there was initial confusion over which County department was  responsible for this aspect of the response. Despite FCS’ predetermined role as  the provider of Emergency Social Services (ESS) in Strathcona County, SCES  personnel continued to manage the Reception Centre that first evening. This was  due in part to the fact that SCES initiated the set up, had better access to current  information and more familiarity with emergency situations. The FCS staff initially  dispatched had prior training, but little experience in such an operation and  therefore deferred to SCES personnel. Further confusion ensued with the arrival  of Victim Services volunteers, as they, too, appeared uncertain of their role and  from whom they should take direction.  Although the issue was quickly resolved,  it highlights a need for further clarification, training and practice with regard to  Emergency Social Service (ESS) roles, expectations and responsibilities.  A second deficiency noted in ESS operations for this incident was the fact  that the \"Emergency Kit\" (forms, supplies, etc) thought to be stored at one of the  Fire Halls no longer existed; it was also unclear who would have been  responsible for bringing the kit out to the Reception Centre if it had existed. To  address this gap, FCS staff at the centre began \"developing forms\" in anticipation  of arriving evacuees. The lack of other on-hand supplies10, however, meant that  the obligation to provide adequate care for evacuees beyond the provision of  shelter, food and water could not have been met immediately, although access to  any required item was available if the need arose.                                                               10 i.e. reading material, activities, spare clothing, hygienic items, diapers, etc.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 34 - December  2010  This experience generated a significant amount of conversation among  FCS staff regarding preparedness and needs for such an event. With assistance  from the pilot Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA), FCS has already  addressed this issue. In the first six months of 2010, Alberta Emergency  Management Agency (AEMA) facilitated training courses for both FCS and  SCEMA staff were conducted on ICS, ESS and Registry & Enquiry (R&I) Centre  operations.  In addition to the courses, the department (in conjunction with  SCEMA) ran a mock disaster exercise in the fall of 2010 to provide their staff an  opportunity to gain experience and confidence in practicing these newly   acquired skills.     2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Clarification, training and practice with regard to Emergency Social  Service (ESS) roles, expectations and responsibilities is crucial to  the efficient operation of a Reception and  R&I Centre during an  emergent event. FCS, in conjunction with the pilot SCEMA, is  already in the process of addressing this situation.    Access to a sufficient supply of forms, lists of needed office supplies,  and other basic necessities is equally crucial to the efficient  operation of a Reception Centre. The preparation of adequate  emergency kits beforehand can not only ensure adequate provision  for evacuees, but also reduces stress levels among workers. This,   in turn, creates a more calming and hospitable environment for all,  an important goal in an already anxiety-provoking situation.            2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 35 - December  2010  Section D – The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)  Section D examines the activities of municipal officials and County  administration working in the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to support  field operations    1. EOC Operation  Data on the operation,  performance and staffing of the EOC  was gathered in the following manner.  On September 30, 2009, an EOC  Debrief was conducted by SCES.  Over  the four days preceding this debrief,  telephone surveys were individually  conducted with County Staff who were  identified from the EOC registration  sheets. These surveys were designed to assess staff comfort with their roles and  responsibilities within the EOC environment, the effectiveness of communication  within the EOC, provide overall feedback on their experience and generate  suggestions for improvement. A summary of survey findings was used to  stimulate thought and generate further discussion at the formal debriefing  session.  The remainder of this Section deals with information so gathered.  1.1  Observations  In late afternoon of May 3 as the magnitude of the 2009 North Strathcona  Wildfire first became apparent, the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was  activated in Conference Centre #1, County Hall, only to be stood down shortly  after midnight when conditions appeared to indicate the fire was under control.  Several hours later, when the winds increased and it became evident that this  assumption was incorrect, the EOC was reopened and remained opened for the  duration of that week (to May 9, 2009).  The Department Operations Centre  (DOC) located at Fire Hall #1 was also run in conjunction with the EOC on  various occasions during that same week.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 36 - December  2010  1.2 Findings:  a) The initial response   In keeping with lessons learned from the 2008 North Strathcona Fire, the  EOC was opened at an early stage of the incident. An overly optimistic analysis  of the situation, however, led to the erroneous conclusion that the EOC was  redundant long before a true sense of the incident had been obtained.  Ironically,  although this decision was no doubt influenced by a natural desire to minimize  inconvenience to EOC staff and maximize operational efficiency, it had exactly  the opposite effect to that intended.   b) Command Coordination and ICS  As mentioned previously, the EOC and the DOC were run in conjunction  from two separate locations during the initial week of the incident. Running two  simultaneous operations centres, however, has the potential to create confusion  and does not follow proper ICS Chain of Command ideology. Ideally, the EOC  should run the entire event with the DOC element physically represented within  the same location. This avoids duplication of effort and delayed access to  important and often time sensitive information.    c) Communications  Overall, survey respondents and debrief participants felt that  communication within the EOC (i.e. about the event, assigned tasks, feedback on  tasks, etc.) was effective. The on time, regular “as promised” briefings, in  particular, were cited by participants as a major positive process.   One or two areas of concern, however, were identified by Legislative and  Legal Services (LLS), the department responsible to keep a record of the actions  and decisions made in the course of the emergency. Oftentimes, these  representatives were not able to capture these points, either because they were  not included in key conversations or were physically located too far away from  ‘the action’ to hear the discussions. According to one participant: “Relying on  overheard conversations is not conducive to good recordkeeping, yet that is often  the way we were able to capture anything”.  Adding to this concern was the fact that the EOC forms intended to  capture a decision or action were not consistently completed and  provided to  LLS. Accurate and timely completion and provision of these forms would not only      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 37 - December  2010  provide a more complete historical record of the event, it would also greatly  enhance the accuracy and completeness of the regular briefings provided to  participants as the incident progressed.  One suggestion for improvement  generated during the debriefing was to provide these forms and briefings in an  electronic format.  This format would allow all participants to access updated  information at their convenience and to communicate asynchronously to avoid  unnecessary workflow disruptions.   This electronic format would necessitate access to the County’s email and  document management system within the EOC, which was another suggestion  for improvement generated from the debrief session.  It was felt that such access  would encourage staff whose offices are located within County Hall, to remain at  their station in the EOC rather than returning to their desks to check on day to  day tasks.  Such absences have not only the potential to delay or interrupt EOC  workflow, but can also create a secondary disruptive effect in the form of  extraneous conversation or “bustle” as staff members enter or leave the room.    One participant reported “there was a sense that if you left the EOC for  any length of time, you needed to catch up quickly” (SCES, 2009).  Provision of  regular bulleted points of development and updates on the outside world, as well  as a “daily summary” at shift changes, was one learning identified that helped to  provide direction and avoid duplication of work and unnecessary interruptions of  other staff.  It is also important to ensure that all visitors and staff in the EOC are  aware of communication and confidentiality protocols.  d) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources  Initial staffing for the EOC  was composed of the Chief  Commissioner in his role as  Director of Emergency  Management and key personnel  from SCES, Corporate Planning &  Intergovernmental Affairs (CPIA)  and Communications, the three  departments most impacted at the  onset of the incident. As the  incident progressed, it became  evident that support from other departments would be required. Staff from  Legislative and Legal Services (LLS), Transportation and Agriculture Services  (TAS) and Information Technology Services (ITS) were called in on May 4 to fill      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 38 - December  2010  the roles previously established for their respective departments through the  Strathcona County Emergency Preparedness Plan.  In addition to internal County  Staff, a representative from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency  (AEMA) was also in attendance to provide a link to related activities happening  simultaneously in other neighboring jurisdictions.  Overall, survey and debrief results indicated that “virtually everyone felt  they knew their roles” although there was some confusion “caused by people  being asked to perform unaccustomed tasks”.  This confusion appeared directly  related to the fact that not all staff in attendance had had previous experience  working in the EOC environment and were thus unsure of the expectations  associated with their assigned role (SCES, 2009). One suggestion to ensure role  competency is to institute a competency “sign-off” for EOC roles.    e) Safety and Accountability  One problem noted within EOC operations was inadequate security and  identification of authorized EOC personnel. The current location of the EOC is  too accessible to the outside world (i.e. large windows) and does not effectively  balance security with access.   As well, although a well-established registration process (and provision of  ID tags for EOC participants) does exist, it was not followed consistently, which  resulted in an incomplete registration record of EOC participants. This came to  light during the debrief, when several County Staff members questioned why they  had not been invited to participate in the survey although they had been part of  EOC operations.    Several participants also reported having issues with people “wandering  in” or “hanging out” in the EOC longer than was strictly necessary. Others  commented on the lack of a clear process on getting information into or out of the  EOC with a minimum of interruption. One participant questioned whether or not  EOC operations conformed to the County’s Occupational Health and Safety  Rules on working alone.    One suggested solution to these issues was to create an “EOC Security  Officer ” role. The presence of the Security Officer could not only serve to  discourage and reduce unauthorized and  unnecessary “visitors”, but could  also facilitate timely contact with the right person at the right time.  This position  could be staffed from any department; it is one opportunity for people from other  departments to fill non-command roles and increase their comfort level with the  inner workings of an EOC.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 39 - December  2010  f) Logistics  Of all operational aspects,  the logistical set-up of the EOC  generated the most discussion.  Although many participants  commented on the calm,  supportive and respectful  environment that existed during  its operation, several critical  technological and physical gaps  were identified:    Technological Gaps   Existing processes and procedures don’t support new technology   GIS and mapping tools located within the EOC are seriously outdated   Inadequate access to basic office equipment such as photocopiers,  printers and faxes   Inadequate capacity for laptop networking and connections   Antiquated phone system   No support TV  monitor for live news feeds or contact with outside  events  Physical gaps:   Set up of room is dictated by antiquated phone system and is not the best  use of space:   busiest departments (i.e. SCES, RCMP, Fleet and Communications)  are all located in one corner of the room   set up of room was confusing, cramped with blocked sight-lines   desks facing the wall not conducive to feeling of “inclusiveness”   No “break-out” rooms or “living environment” for night time operations  or food  breaks   No clear floor plan provided to reduce set up time    No floor plan and  schedule provided outside the room to clearly identify  positions and roles. This has since been addressed by the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA).   Confusion over what information and  tools should be kept in  Department EOC kits and who is responsible to update same        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 40 - December  2010  g) Planning, Training and Preparedness  Another suggestion on increasing comfort levels in the various EOC roles  and expectations, or in other words, on overcoming the “EOC Mystique”, was to  encourage “uninvolved” staff to visit and observe the EOC in action. This solution  is problematic, however, as it runs directly counter to the need (as discussed in  the previous section) of discouraging and reducing unauthorized and   unnecessary “visitors”.  Furthermore, as research into best practices indicates  that ICS is becoming the national standard for handling emergency situations in  both Canada and the United States, future Strathcona EOC activations will be  transitioning towards an ICS-based operation. This will necessitate that all  potential EOC staff must have, at the very least, a basic understanding of ICS  organization, basic terminology and the common responsibilities associated with  ICS assignments.   A more realistic solution would therefore be to provide appropriate  training, reinforced through practical application of this new skill set by means of  table-top and mock disaster exercises. In keeping with this latter, more practical  solution, a new ICS and EOC training program has already been initiated through  the SCEMA pilot previously mentioned. As of the date of this report, over 100  staff members have already participated in this new training program and are  now certified at the ICS 100 (introductory) level.     1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   The EOC should be opened earlier than later in an emergent situation,  and kept open on a continuous basis until it is certain that the incident  is and will remain under control   The EOC should encompass the DOC as opposed to running two  operations centres in conjunction at separate locations. The EOC  should run the entire event with the DOC element physically  represented within the same location. This avoids duplication of effort  and delayed access to important and often time sensitive information.     Have forms and briefings available electronically   Have County email and document management systems available at  all EOC workstations to relieve day to day work pressures   Provide regular bulleted points of development and updates on the  outside world.  continued next page      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 41 - December  2010      1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned (cont’d)   Provide a daily summary brief at each shift change   Ensure all visitors and staff are aware of communication and  confidentiality protocols   Involve more departments in initial EOC staffing to ensure  continuity and more accurate historical record keeping   Provide a “heads up” to departments who may need to play a role  in the EOC to allow them to get into a “state of readiness”   Institute a “sign-off” for EOC role competencies   An EOC technological and physical needs assessment is required  to ensure updated processes and procedures, along with the  appropriate, updated and necessary tools, are in place   Update and enforce consistent registration and ID tag process and  procedures   Establish an “EOC Security Officer ” role   Encourage all Strathcona County departments to strategize and  suggest other potential contributions their staff could make in the  EOC during an emergent event   As research into best practices indicates that ICS is becoming the  national standard for handling emergency situations in both Canada  and the United States, future Strathcona EOC activations will be  transitioning towards an ICS-based operation. A training program  on ICS ideology and principles has been initiated for all potential  EOC staff, to be reinforced through practical application by means  of table-top and mock disaster exercises         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 42 - December  2010  Section E – Public Communications  The following section deals with all public communications, specifically  public alerting, updates and media notification. Information for the following  section was provided by Communications Department through a review of their  files, telephone and website logs, staff accounts and anecdotal evidence.      1. Communications Plan   Throughout the course of the 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire, Strathcona  County Communications Department worked closely with SCES and others in  the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). Their role was to ensure that  consistent information was made available in a timely manner to a range of  stakeholders as the incident evolved.   1.1 Observations  Communications personnel  were involved in the incident from  Sunday, May 3 when the EOC initially  opened, and throughout the week  while the EOC was in operation.  Although the need for Communications  assistance was reduced considerably  after the EOC closed, the need for a  certain level of support continued,  gradually tapering off, for a number of  weeks. This support extended through  May and June in the form of updates to  the UPDATEline11, 211 and the County  website, with the last update provided on July 2. Topics included the fire ban,  periodic local traffic notices and safety messages as work on extinguishing area  hotspots continued.                                                               11 The UPDATEline is a 24-hour recorded information line operated by the Northeast Region Community  Awareness Emergency Response (NR CAER) to provide important information on industrial activity  and  ongoing emergent situations. (http:/ .nrcaer.com  /  UPDATEline    -US .aspx )  Media accessing the incident site.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 43 - December  2010  1.2 Findings  Communication during the wildfires was based on the following key points:   Use all available communications methods and media.    Repeat referrals to basic information sources, specifically the  UPDATEline and the Strathcona County website. Over the course  of the wildfires, the media made use of these as well as the public.   Provide regular and frequent updates even when the situation  shows little to no change. This serves to reassure and confirm that  the message does indeed contain the most up to date information.       Anticipate questions and feedback from the public and centralize  the flow of information through a single source, the Emergency  Public Information Officer (EPIO) Communications Team.    Provide clear, consistent messaging. Where personal safety or  property is at risk, information needs to be unambiguous, consistent  and readily available.   During the wildfire, the County was generally successful in maintaining  good communication; few or no instances were identified of misinformation or  cases where people did not feel they were adequately informed.  A prime consideration was  communication with residents in the  immediate area; in other words, the  municipality’s duty to inform the public  of the potential for rapidly worsening  conditions and the possibility of  evacuation.  Another key audience  was area industry. Accurate and timely  information enabled them to take the  necessary steps to mitigate any  cascading affect the fire might have  had on their facilities. Given the size and intensity of the fire, there was also  considerable interest from the news media and the community at large.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 44 - December  2010                                2. Communication tools   As indicated previously, a variety of communication tools were used to  ensure rapid, comprehensive and timely dispersal of information to both the  public and the media as the incident progressed.  These tools ranged from  messages released via internet and telecommunications-based technology to  resident information packages hand-distributed to evacuees in hard copy format.   2.1 Observations  A total of 13 news releases and updates went to the media via email  between May 3 and 8. Each release was approved by the senior SCES  representative in the EOC. Communications staff, in their role of Emergency  Public Information Officers (EPIO), served as the first point of contact for media  inquiries, with SCES officers providing all follow-up comments to the media and  1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   The communications plan requires reorganization for immediacy   and ease of use   Message templates need to be readily available for web, news  media, phone centre, resident information, etc.   More staff need to be recruited and trained in the Emergency Public  Information Officer (EPIO)1 role to allow for redundancy and staff  rotation during multiple operational periods for incidents of longer  duration. Communications, in conjunction with the pilot SCEMA, has  already addressed this situation through an AEMA facilitated EPIO  course held for all communications staff from across the County.   Messages should be disseminated using as wide a variety of  communication tools as possible to ensure a rapid, comprehensive  and timely dispersal of accurate and consistent information      1 The ICS EPIO “serves as the conduit for information to internal and external stakeholders, including  the media…, seeking information directly from the incident or event” (City of Edmonton Office of  Emergency Preparedness, July 2009, p. 41).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 45 - December  2010  doing all interviews. This included interviews in person at the Incident Command  Post (ICP) and via the phone from the EOC. In order to better accommodate the  many media requests, daily media briefings were scheduled for May 5 and 6 at  prearranged times on-site at the ICP.   Communications also prepared and posted over 16 wildfire updates to the  Strathcona County website between Sunday, May 3, at 18:15 hours and Friday,  May 8, at 11:30 hours.  Furthermore, as new information was released by the  EOC, it was electronically circulated via an email list to interested stakeholders,  including industry, business, County staff, neighboring municipalities, SRD, MLAs  and other affected parties.   To ensure a comprehensive distribution of messages, Communications  also utilized telecommunications technology. During the period from May 3 to  May 11, 13 emergency messages were posted on the UPDATELine, which were  listened to 493 times. In addition to the emergency messages, 11 information  messages were also posted and accessed 143 times. These updates continued  through to the end of June as work continued at the site. County information was  also provided to the Alberta Wildfires Update Line. This line is coordinated by the  Community Relations Staff at Alberta Sustainable Resource Development (SRD)  in conjunction with affected municipalities.   In addition to pre-recorded messages, Communications also assisted with  three emergency warning call-outs to residents, all done through the North east  Region Community Awareness Emergency Response (NR CAER) Community  Notification System (CNS)12 (May 4: voluntary evacuation, May 5: mandatory  evacuation, May 7: evacuation lifted).   Anticipating calls from the public as a result of the wildfires, a Telephone  Inquiry Centre was established at 13:00 hours on May 4. The Centre received all  approved information updates from the EOC and was staffed by County  employees who could answer calls, convey messages to the EOC, or otherwise  assist callers. Telephone Centre staff worked a total of 66.5 hours between May  4 and May 8 and took 68 calls.                                                                12 The Northeast Region CAER CNS is an automated call-out system used to inform Strathcona residents  about more serious incidents in their immediate area. In emergency situations, residents who have  registered for this service will receive a phone call with safety information and instructions.  (http:/ .nrcaer.com       - US .aspx )      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 46 - December  2010  During this incident, Strathcona County also piloted the use of the 211  service. Message scripts were conveyed to 211 operators through the  Information and Volunteer Centre (IVC), and County website and phone lines  referred after-hour callers to this service. Updated information and answers to  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) were provided throughout May and into  June when the fire ban in the area took effect.   On Friday, May 8, as Fire Chief Reid arranged to meet with residents  returning to their homes, Communications prepared hard copy information  packages to be left with each returning family. These packages included a  message with key contact information, FireSmart and other materials.  No  specific feedback was obtained with regard to this communication tool.  For samples of messages and information packages, please see  Appendix 7.  2.2 Findings  a) Media releases, briefings and interviews   Providing news releases and updates to the media via email proved  extremely efficient and was well received by media representatives, as were the  regularly scheduled briefings.  Having SCES Command Officers available for  interviews also proved particularly effective in providing context and first-hand  experience to supplement the general information provided through the updates.   As the incident was winding down, all incident-related media enquiries  were directed to a special email address (emergencyinfo@strathcona.ab.ca)  previously created for this purpose as a result of learnings from the 2008 fire and  many industrial responses. This proved very effective and has since become an  integral part of ongoing SCES public communication protocols.   b) Strathcona County Website (www.strathcona.ab.ca)   The week of May 4 saw the largest number of daily visits in the history of  the County website, due in part to the number of people seeking information  about the wildfire. The wildfire page received 1,012 visits on Tuesday, May 5,  making it the second-most visited page on the website (total visits that day to the  County website: 6,548). It was also the second-most visited page on the  following day (Wednesday, May 6) with a total of 1,122 visits (total visits to the  site that day: 5,975).  It is not unreasonable to suggest that this statistic supports  the claim that regular updates are necessary, even if the message stays the      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 47 - December  2010  same. Not only does this reassure the public that they are receiving the latest  and most up to date information, it also has the potential of reducing  unauthorized activity within the response. In fact, research has proven that  “access to information (or lack thereof) is a key factor” in whether or not such  activity occurs (Fowler, 2008, p.v).  c) Email updates   The above claim is also supported by the manner in which the emailed  information updates were received by those on the email list referred to  previously.  These email updates were well received and widely circulated, as  evidenced by the following comment from an industry communicator: “The news  releases  were great – they were brief, to the point and read well via  BlackBerry. I think this is also a great way to get info to employees and  contractors and keep them informed”.  d) The UPDATELine, 1-866-653-9959  It is interesting to note the unprecedented use of this communication tool  by Strathcona County residents and visitors at the height of the incident.  Typically, the UPDATEline is only accessed around 300 times per month. During  the 2009 North Strathcona wildfire, it was accessed over 600 times in the first  week alone.    Since that time, SCES has both taken advantage of and encouraged a  continued heightened public awareness of this communication tool by expanding  its role in ongoing SCES public communication protocols.  Information messages  on topics ranging from live fire training and fire ban announcements to air quality  advisories are now routinely posted on the UPDATEline.   e) Community Notification System (CNS) Call-outs   Although Strathcona County has had access to the NR CAER CNS since  its inception in early 2003, the system had rarely, if ever, been utilized by County  staff. Although operator training had been initially provided, these skills had not  been maintained either through practice or actual use in the intervening years. As  a result, the County was unable to independently launch the system when  required. Instead, Communications staff prepared and recorded the message for  the NR CAER Communications Officer, Brenda Gheran, who handled the actual  launch to the designated area.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 48 - December  2010  In addition to the operational complexities of the launch, several instances  came to light of affected residents not being registered for call-outs. The wildfire  therefore not only highlighted operational gaps in the notification process, it also  provided an opportunity for the end user to see the value of registering for this  community emergency notification system.  f) Telephone Inquiry Centre  To help centralize information flow during emergencies, Strathcona’s  Communications Plan calls for a Telephone Inquiry Centre to be set up in  Meeting Room A in County Hall. Only the main County switchboard number  (780-464-8111) is publicized; the receptionist receives all calls and directs them  to one of the phones located in Meeting Room A.  While the number of calls received in this case was not excessively large,  it is nonetheless worthwhile to activate this centralized source and be prepared to  adjust the number of staff available to answer calls should the situation change.   g) 211  This was the first time Strathcona County has used the 211 service to  disseminate information. It was particularly useful in this case as the line is in  operation on weekends and evenings. Feedback indicated a number of callers  utilized the 211 option for information, particularly with respect to ATV use in the  area affected by wildfires.            2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Incorporating and optimizing the use of a special email address for  media inquiries provides a single, trusted and convenient source of  information for the media.    For media briefings, it is important to provide enough notice to allow  for travel to the location. Prearranged times and locations are  beneficial when an event is anticipated to be prolonged, however,  further consideration is required on how to better accommodate  media at the site. Assigning a special “media area” outside the  incident perimeter, and arranging a “media pool”1 are two common  methods of achieving this result. continued next page    1 Media Pooling generally involves one print, one radio and one TV representative, selected by the  media, themselves, who are allowed within the site under escort “to get the story on the understanding  that all outlets will have access to the resulting images, information and interviews”   (AEMA, 2008, p.57).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 49 - December  2010              2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned  (cont’d)   A consistent and constantly updated message is a key factor in  increasing public confidence in response efforts and lessening  the potential for emergent activity.   Use of 24 hour tools such as the UPDATEline and 211 for  dissemination of information to the public is highly effective,  provided that the information obtained from these sources is  always accurate and up to date.     Although further technical training and practice for in-house  launch of the CNS call-out system is required, the system did  work as intended during the incident; residents were alerted. This  incident demonstrates to both residents and staff that the system  is effective, and stresses the value of registering for this service.   A single, central number for public inquiries proved effective;  however, the capacity of the current physical set up would be  taxed in a more widespread incident.    Clear protocols for delivering messages and information to and  from the EOC require further development.   It is essential to be well prepared with more staff on stand-by to  handle calls in case the situation escalates.  The willingness of  staff to work in the Telephone Inquiry Centre on short notice was  impressive; however, the process of training, scheduling and  recruiting phone centre staff requires refinement.          2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 50 - December  2010  Section F – Remediation and Cost Recovery  This section deals with remediation efforts undertaken in the area, as well  as subsequent cost recovery measures.  Emergency Management generally  refers to this as the Recovery phase of an incident.       1. Remediation   Information for this segment was derived from the files, debriefing notes  and anecdotal evidence supplied by the various departments involved in the  recovery phase of this incident.   1.1 Observations:  On June 16, 2009, in conjunction with the North Strathcona Contact Office  (Corporate Planning & Intergovernmental Affairs [CPIA]), SCES held an open  house at Fire Station #4, Heartland Hall, for residents in north Strathcona who  were affected by the incident.  Councillor Fenske, Fire Chief Darrell Reid, Deputy  Fire Chiefs Bushell and Elliott and the Heartland Service Area and Rural Liaison  Coordinator, Dinah Canart, were on hand to give presentations describing the  events and outcomes of the incident and to answer resident questions and  concerns.     Actual recovery and remediation efforts were initiated in the months of  August, September and October. Work was awarded to contracted services  managed by County staff and was completed by December 1, 2009. In the end,  over three kilometers of dozer guard and fence lines were repaired.  1.2 Findings  a) Resident Feedback  The Resident Information Open House on June 16 was well attended.   Information presented to the residents included overviews on operations,  challenges faced during the incident and other emergency management issues.   Feedback from residents was generally positive; some concerns were raised   and duly addressed, including control of the recreational area and possible  improvements to communications. A major resident concern, that SCES did not  fully utilize resources present at the scene, was dispelled through provision of the      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 51 - December  2010  fact that the resource in question had been self deployed; in other words, it was  operating independently of SCES command. As previously mentioned in Section  C-1.2 a) of this report, research has shown not only that such “spontaneous  organizations often outstrip the capacity of emergency managers to effectively  utilize them”, but “may [also] create serious problems for first responders”  (McEntire, 2004, p.16). For these and other reasons (including cost concerns), a  decision was made not to include this particular resource in the official response.   Another issue raised was the great deal of time it was taking for the  County to repair land and fences damaged by fire operations.  The explanation  for this delay was that the Municipal Wildfire Assistance Program (MWAP) was  available to cover the repairs for this fire and the County wanted to ensure  residents were aware of this.  b) Fire Breaks and Fence Lines  In addition to damage caused by the actual fire, fence lines on both public  and private land had been compromised to enable the movement of equipment  for fire operations. Furthermore, in order to contain the fire, crews created “dozer  guards” (fire breaks), which is the clearing of forested areas to restrict the  movement of fire and prevent it from “crowning” through trees and brush.    Throughout August, September and October, SCES representatives  worked with legal advice to develop a formal and consistent method of:   identifying property requiring any repairs   meeting with residents to review repair requirements   receiving and verifying formal repair requests, and developing a work  plan for completion  Overall, repairs to property were restricted to damaged fence lines and  areas where bulldozers had dug dozer guards (i.e. removed standing trees and  cultivated the ground to minimize the availability of fuel). Representatives from  both SCES and Transportation and Agriculture Services (TAS) visited affected  residents to establish an exact estimate of restoration requirements. The  following deductions were derived by using Alberta Sustainable Resource global  positioning to corroborate the information provided by residents:   Approximately 8,529 meters of fire break was constructed;  approximately 3,100 meters was on land owned by corporations       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 52 - December  2010   A number of smaller fire breaks had been built immediately off lease  roads on private land in the northern part of the area. By late summer,  these breaks had already witnessed substantial re-growth.   Actual repairs came to an estimated cost of $125,000, and consisted of:   re-grading the land   fixing fence lines damaged or cut during response operations   mulching felled trees   planting grass seed where requested by the landowner.  One concern raised by a resident during this process dealt with the fact  that “cleaning” dozer guard areas would actually improve access for off-road  vehicles. This is a serious concern, as the possibility of increased human activity  could increase the risk of future fire in the area.                      2. Cost Recovery   Information for the following section was provided by Executive  Administration, Community Services Division through a review of their files, staff  accounts and anecdotal evidence.   2.1 Observations  An application for recovery of costs associated with the 2009 North  Strathcona Wildfire was made on September 11, 2009 to the Municipal Wildfire  1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Open communication can greatly increase public confidence in  response and remediation efforts   Further investigation is required on adequate control of human  activity in natural areas for the purpose of reduced fire risk              2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 53 - December  2010  Assistance Program (MWAP)13.  The actual cost of the fire was $4.7 million; the  application was based on $4.2 million in eligible incident costs.  From this, the  County expected to receive $2.6 million, representing an estimated claim of  $2,700 for emergency operations, $150,000 for infrastructure damage and  $2,400,000 for firefighting .   AEMA acknowledged receipt of the application on September 15 and  advised approval of the program for Strathcona on November 26, 2009. In June  2010, Strathcona County received a payment from MWAP of just over   $2.1 million.   2.2 Findings  According to MWAP guidelines, the municipality is “eligible for  reimbursement of all costs associated with the suppression of the wildfire that are  in excess of $25 per capita (at a rate of 75% of eligible costs)”. As the wildfire  occurred in the rural service area, a formal request was made (and accepted) for  the program to use only the rural population (26,112) in reimbursement  calculations (Strathcona County, 2009, p.2). This request was based on the  Order in Council designating Strathcona County as a specialized municipality  (referred to in Section A), and substantially increased the County’s potential  reimbursement amount.   In total, the County originally anticipated recovering approximately $2.6  million under the program; we received $2.1 million, representing a total  difference of approximately $529,000 between what was claimed and what was  paid. This was due to the fact that some costs were considered ineligible under  the program and costs for emergency service vehicles and materials such as  hoses, goggles and nozzles were paid at a greatly discounted rate. This is  something to keep in mind for future incidents requiring the County to accrue  expected cost recovery.  The MWAP application itself, completed by the Coordinator, Financial  Systems and the Accountant, Community Services (Executive Administration),  on behalf of SCES, required copies of every invoice related to the fire, as well as  copies of all related payroll and vehicle cost records. Collecting said records  proved an onerous task; although staff from all affected departments responded  fairly quickly, there is a great deal of paperwork and effort involved in such a  request on such short notice. It is suggested that, should this issue arise in                                                              13 MWAP is a province wide program “intended to help reduce both the risk and losses associated with  wildfires…designed to assist municipalities with extraordinary costs for the suppression of wildfires when  they occur (http:/ .municipalaffairs.alberta.ca  .pdf).       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 54 - December  2010  future, a clearer explanation of the significance of the task (and its potential  consequential value for the County) should accompany any similar requests.   The fact that the County established a sub ledger accounting code for the  fire from the very beginning was a “life saver” and greatly simplified cost tracking  efforts. The sub ledger code was used to record all incident-related costs except  for regular staff hours. This exclusion, however, did cause some issues with the  MWAP application. Although a detailed record of regular staff hours was also  requested, only overtime and casual temporary staff hour records could be  supplied.   2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned    It is unlikely that the full amount claimed for vehicles (fire vehicles  in particular) will be received under provincial reimbursement  programs. This is something to keep in mind for future incidents  requiring the County to accrue expected cost recovery   A clear, comprehensive explanation of the significance of any  onerous task (and its potential consequential value for the  County) could facilitate staff compliance with such requests made  on short notice   A special sub ledger accounting code established at the onset of  a potentially costly event can greatly facilitate cost tracking  efforts; this should be used without exception for all incident- related costs, including regular staff hours        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 55 - December  2010  References    211 Edmonton.

It is significant to note that the  natural forested area just north west of this  location suffered a similar, but smaller wildfire  in May of the previous year.   The fire’s progression necessitated the Declaration of a State of Local  Emergency (SOLE) for Strathcona County on May 5, 2009. Although the  declaration was terminated two days later on May 7, SCES crews remained at  work in the  natural forested area just north west of this  location until July 3 when the incident was officially declared to be over.   Through May and June, their efforts were supported by a number of other  resources including the Salvation Army and other community groups, municipal  and industrial partners, provincial agencies and County departments. SCES also  received assistance from residents (i.e. food provision, water hauling and fire  break cultivation, etc.).    Approximately 90 forestry fire fighters from Sustainable Resource  Development (SRD) were deployed into the  natural forested area just north west of this  location at the height of the event. Approximately 90 forestry fire fighters from Sustainable Resource  Development (SRD)remained in the  natural forested area just north west of this  location approximately three to four weeks after the fire was under  control to assist SCES crews dealing with stubborn areas of dead brush, trees  and peat.    In total, the fire is estimated to have impacted an area of over 8,500 acres  of land; 14 times the size of the fire which occurred in 2008. the fire  briefly crossed the  North Saskatchewan River into Sturgeon County, and incurred a total cost to  Strathcona County of approximately $4.7 Million. Despite the size and complexity  of the event, however, the three major goals set by SCES at the outset were met.  No residents were injured, no homes were lost and only two minor firefighter  injuries occurred.         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 2 - December  2010  1. Approach  This After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 2 - December  2010   describes the activities of Strathcona  County and Strathcona   mutual aid partners in response to that portion of the fire affecting  the North Strathcona area. This After Action Report (AAR) describes the activities of Strathcona  County and its mutual aid partners in response to that portion of the fire affecting  the North Strathcona area incorporates the views of persons at all levels and  includes all available data gathered from participating organizations.   Data was compiled through a series of surveys, debriefings, GIS mapping  applications and a review of all fire-related department records. Data was analyzed  using a qualitative approach and the results broken into six principle sections.    Section A: Strathcona County, Alberta provides a synopsis of  Strathcona County governance and emergency management policies in place  during the incident. Section A: Strathcona County, Alberta concludes with an overview of Strathcona County  Emergency Services (SCES) history, organization and other issues impacting the  department at the time.  Section B: Prevention Measures looks at policies and  measures taken to prevent and  mitigate the effects of wildfire in Strathcona  County, both before and after the incident. Section C: Field Operations  investigates all aspects of the response effort in the field during the course of the  wildfire, including that of Emergency Social Services (ESS) provided to  evacuees. Section D: The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) examines the  performance of the EOC in support of field operations. Section E: Public  Communications deals with all aspects of communication with the public,  specifically public alerting, updates and media notification.  Section F:  Remediation and Cost Recovery deals with remediation efforts undertaken in  the area, as well as subsequent cost recovery measures.   Information in the above noted sections is organized in a standard format:  observations describe what transpired; findings present and analyze what was  learned from the perspective of the response participants; recommendations  and lessons learned describe “potential improvements that were naturally  derived from the findings” (Titan Systems Corporation, n.d., p.2).  The report concludes with a list of References from both academic and  field research sources, and a series of Appendices, both of which offer  supplementary or background information to support the claims and statements  made in the preceding sections.   The remainder of this introduction provides a context for the reader  through an excerpt from the 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire Investigation Report,  and concludes with an executive summary of best practice recommendations for  improved performance in future disaster events.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 3 - December  2010  2. Excerpt - 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire Investigative Report   The following is an excerpt taken from the  official fire investigation report of   Fire Marshal Dale Miller.1   On May 3, 2009 at 14:42 hours,  Strathcona County Emergency Services 911  Centre received the first of thirty-four (34) calls  reporting brush fires in the Heartland Industrial  Region and in the Lamont County area east of  Highway (Hwy) 830. the fire initiated at almost  the exact same time as another major wild land  fire was developing approximately 7 kilometers  east of the fire location in the Lamont County region.  At the time that these two fires were reported, it was the recorded hottest time of  day (21.2-22.8ºC), with the lowest humidity (15-16%) and the highest winds (24-33  kph). Vegetation ground cover was very dry with little new (spring) growth  occurring.  The high temperature and low humidity contributed to the creation of  what is termed in the industry as a “cross-over”, which accelerates fire growth  exponentially.   This specific area is frequented by off road vehicle users, equestrian  enthusiasts, as well as oil and gas and power line servicemen.  Heartland Hall (Strathcona County Fire Station 4 at Hwy 15 and Hwy 830),  Fire Station 5 (Baseline Rd and Cloverbar Rd, Sherwood Park) and Platoon  Chief Nixon were simultaneously dispatched at 14:46 hours.  Platoon Chief Nixon reported that while enroute to the fire scene Platoon Chief Nixon  witnessed two distinctly separate columns of smoke visible on the northern  horizon [see Figure 1].  The column to the west was consistent light grey   in colour with the occasional charge of dark brown  and increasing intensity.  The smoke to the east (assumed at the time to be east of Hwy 830) was larger in  diameter than the fire but appeared to be less intense with consistently  lighter coloured smoke. Based on the size and reading of the smoke conditions,  dispatch was directed to respond additional tankers, brush trucks and engine  crews from Sherwood Park as well as the outlying stations, page command  officers and address the need for mutual aid.                                                                1 the  official fire investigation report of   Fire Marshal Dale is available upon written request to the Fire Chief and Manager of Strathcona County  Emergency Services.                         Dale Miller, Fire Marshal  Strathcona County Emergency Services        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 4 - December  2010              2.1 Life Assessment  Based on the initial assessment of dispatch information, the potential for  fire extension, the fuel load involved and the proximity of residential buildings, it  was determined that there was immediate threat to civilian and animal life as a  result of the incident.  2.2 Exposure Concerns  Based on consideration of the fuel load, wind, moisture conditions, grade  of terrain and fire extension prior to our arrival on scene, it was concluded that  there was significant opportunity for extension outward along the eastern and  western flanks of the fire. While the leading edge was being directed towards   the river, the intensity of the fire and fuel packages in This specific area presented a   significant concern that the river width would fail to completely contain the fire   on the north front.  2.3 Investigative Findings:  our hypothesize that due to human activity and  machinery or vehicle  failure, a fire initiated on the tinder dry vegetative ground debris and developed to  where the fire spread rapidly, with the assistance of the wind…on the ground  surface along the power line service road. the fire flanked into the adjacent tree  stands where a greater fuel matrix is available. The fire back burned from the  Point of Origin along the west aspect of the pipeline right-of-way (ROW) but did  not cross east of the ROW due to a lack of fuels available (sand base trails and  road) and low intensity fire (back burning along fine ground fuels). The back  burning fire flanked into the west adjacent tree stand, and with an assistance of  the predominate meteorological winds, enhanced the advancing northbound fire.  These fire forces intensified the heat and travel speed even further which  contributed to the development of 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire.  Figure 1: Smoke columns, May 3, 2009      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 5 - December  2010  Relying upon deductive reasoning this hypothesis led to the following  conclusion.  2.4 Investigative Conclusion:   the fire is deemed Accidental in nature.  Due to the absence of evidence, we are not able to completely rule out  incendiarism, however, having two fires initiating at the same time of day  several kilometers apart and confirming that both areas had heavy  recreational activity occurring, the balance of probabilities weights on the  fire being accident in nature and caused by human activity and   machinery or vehicle failure.  FIRE ORIGIN:   On ground litter debris located:  Her Majesty – Alberta Energy  SE 22–56–21-W4  Northing 5969117.700, Easting 63912300  (NAD 83 3TM Central Meridian 114 Degrees West)  West aspect of pipeline ROW south of TWP 562, west of Range Rd 212  Strathcona County, Alberta  [Please see Appendix 1 for an aerial map of the area of origin. For further  details on the size of the fire as it appeared on May 3, please see  Appendix 2 for a map of it perimeter.]  FIRE CAUSE:   The Cause of the fire is Undetermined… At this time we are not able to  test a hypothesis without a reliable ignition source. The balance of  probabilities weights on the fire being caused by human activity and   machinery or vehicle failure.  End of excerpt as cited from Miller (2010).          2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 6 - December  2010  3. Executive Summary   In view of the size and complexity of  the event, that no residents were injured,  no homes were lost and no serious  firefighter injuries occurred is a major  accomplishment for Strathcona County  Emergency Services (SCES). In fact, Sustainable Resource  Development (SRD)forestry workers commented, “all our staff  were very impressed by Strathcona County  commitment to evacuations and structural  protection. Thought it was top notch all the  way…All County Departments did an excellent  job at providing… protection on this  …incident” (as cited in Reid, June, 2009).    This could not have been achieved  without assistance and support from SCES  Mutual Aid and Industrial partners, some of  whom were engaged in dealing with SCES  Mutual Aid and Industrial partners, some of  whom were engaged in dealing with their own emergencies own emergencies. Sturgeon and  Lamont Counties, for example, were fighting simultaneous wildfires in Sturgeon and  Lamont Countiesrespective jurisdictions. Fortunately, SRD resources were available to respond  and SRD resources assistance and expertise greatly enhanced the response effort.   SCES   also gratefully acknowledges assistance and support received from  residents. This ranged from tasks such as water hauling, food provision, livestock  evacuation and tilling of fields for firebreaks, to cooperation with evacuations and  area restrictions.    All County Departments made  ongoing, invaluable contributions to  the effort in both response and  recovery phases. In fact, this was a  major learning derived from the  incident; All County Departments play a role  in disaster response.     Other lessons learned  involved best practices in public  communication and notification,  utilizing community resources and      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 7 - December  2010  provision of support for affected residents2. Additional learnings highlighted the  advantages of public education, ongoing training for SCES   and other County  staff, and a “proactive approach towards ‘all-hazards’ emergency preparedness”  (Reid, June, 2009).    the incident proved challenging in many respects and generated several  recommendations for improvement. Some of several  recommendations for improvement have  already been addressed and  implemented, including:   refinement of prevention, preparedness and emergency notification  policies and procedures in Strathcona County  , including a  Strathcona County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA)  pilot project   creation of a wider public awareness of such policies, procedures  and measures   full adoption and training in Incident Command System (ICS)  concepts across all Strathcona County departments for all  employees involved in the response to major emergencies   continued wildland fire training for SCES   members   continued training and practice in emergency social service (ESS),  public information and emergency operations centre (EOC) roles  for County employees and potential volunteers   refinement of remediation and cost tracking practices for   optimum recovery                                                                     2 Emergency Social Services (ESS)      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 8 - December  2010  Section A: Strathcona County  , Alberta  To provide further context for this After Action Report, Section A presents  a synopsis of Strathcona County governance and emergency management  policies in place during the incident. To provide further context for this After Action Report, Section A presents  a synopsis of Strathcona County governance and emergency management  policies in place during the incident concludes with an overview of Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES) history, organization and other issues  impacting the department at the time.      1. The Municipality  Ranked among Alberta’s five largest municipalities (Alberta Municipal  Affairs, 2010), Strathcona County   is a unique blend of rural, urban and industrial  development located in the Heartland Industrial  Region on the eastern boundary of the City of  Edmonton. Occupying an area of 1,265 square kilometers with a population of  87,998 (as of the 2009 Census), Strathcona County   consists of the “urban area of  Sherwood Park and an extensive rural area… which includes eight rural hamlets,  Antler Lake, Ardrossan, Collingwood Cove, Half Moon Lake, Hastings Lake,  Josephburg, North Cooking Lake and South Cooking Lake.”   To provide for “the unique needs of a municipality that includes both a  large urban centre and a significant rural territory and population”, Strathcona County  was classified as a specialized municipality in 1996, one of only five in the  province.  This means that the “Sherwood Park Urban Service Area is  recognized as the equivalent to a city by the Government of Alberta, and the  Rural Service Area (meaning the territory of Strathcona County   excluding the  Sherwood Park Urban Service Area) for the purposes of enactments, is treated  as a municipal district” (Strathcona County, 2007).  1.1 Governance and Emergency Management Policies  The Municipality   is governed by a nine-member Council led by  a Mayor (elected at large), and one Councillor for each of the eight political  wards, all serving rotating three-year terms. In the calendar year 2009, Cathy  Olesen served as Mayor and Jacquie Fenske served as Councillor for Ward 5,  the “Sherwood Park Urban Service Area most impacted by the fire. a nine-member Council led by  a Mayor (elected at large) was composed of Vic  Bidzinski (Ward 1), Roxanne Carr (Ward 2), Peter Wlodarczak (Ward 4), Alan  Dunn (Ward 6), Glen Lawrence (Ward 7) and Jason Gariepy (Ward 8).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 9 - December  2010        County Administration is led by a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), who  is known as the Chief Commissioner, appointed by Council according to Section  205 of the Municipal Governance Act (Strathcona County  , 2005). In Strathcona  ,  the Chief Commissioner leads an Executive Team which includes four Associate  Commissioners, each responsible for one of the Strathcona County  ’s four administrative  divisions: Capital Region Initiatives3, Corporate Services, Community Services  and Infrastructure and Planning Services. Together, an Executive Team which includes four Associate  Commissioners, each responsible for one of the County’s four administrative  divisions: Capital Region Initiatives3, Corporate Services, Community Services  and Infrastructure and Planning Services oversee almost 2,000  full time, part time and seasonal Strathcona County employees, to provide a wide  range of services to County residents, business and industry (please see  Appendix 3 for the 2009 Strathcona County Divisional Organization chart).  In 2009, Robyn Singleton served as Chief Commissioner of Strathcona  County. Denise Exton was Associate Commissioner, Community Services, the  division which includes the Emergency Services department.   Remaining  members of the Executive Team were David Turner (Capital Region Initiatives),  George Huybregts (Corporate Services) and Peter Vana (Infrastructure &  Planning Services).                                                                        3 This Administrative Division was discontinued in 2010.

Turner        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 10 - December  2010  In addition to his administrative duties, the Chief Commissioner (or his  delegate) also acts as the County’s Director of Emergency Management. his is  supported in this role by the Fire Chief, who acts as Deputy Director, Emergency  Management.  The County’s Emergency Management Plan is composed of an  overarching “Coordinating Plan” (which outlines in general terms each  Department’s area of responsibility) and individual Department plans. The County’s Emergency Management Plan is administered and maintained by SCES  , however, each department is  responsible for the composition and maintenance of each department portion of the  document. The County’s Emergency Management Plan is deemed confidential due to the amount of personal  information contained therein, and access to the whole is limited to Executive  Team, County Managers and Coordinators.   The following overview of the history and organization of Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES), which includes other issues impacting the  department at the time, provides an additional framework for the observations  and findings contained in the remainder of this After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 6 - December  2010  3.     2. Strathcona County Emergency Services (SCES)  SCES   was first established as a  volunteer fire brigade in November  1956, operating out of a member’s  private garage with a donated half-ton  truck and some fire fighting equipment.  At the time, incidents were reported by  a telephone operator who would  individually phone each volunteer with  muster instructions. If the call came  during the day when the men were at  work, the men wives would respond in the men  place (Harrington, 1983).   Much has changed since then. Today, SCES   is a combination of full time  (career) and part time (on call) fire fighters working in a fully integrated municipal  fire / rescue / emergency medical services (EMS) department.  SCES career  members are Fire Fighter  or Fire Fighter  Medical  Technicians (EMTs), fully trained in both disciplines. Fire, rescue and EMS all  operate out of three full time fire stations, providing a complete range of  emergency services to Strathcona County  . In addition to the full time stations,  Strathcona County volunteer fire fighters  circa 1959.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 11 - December  2010  SCES   also operates two rural part time stations, manned by on-call first  responders. In November 2006, the department celebrated fifty years of  exemplary community service and in May 2009, had a complement of over 200  full and part time staff responding out of five stations located throughout Strathcona County  .  the department professed mission:   With integrity and courage, through focus and commitment, Strathcona  County Emergency Services (SCES) will:   Protect the health and safety of our fire fighters, emergency  responders and the public   Lessen pain and suffering and preserve quality of life   Protect the environment   Protect property   Deliver superior emergency situation management   Promote safety awareness through public education   Maintain public confidence   (Strathcona County Emergency Services, 2010)  the department professed vision is to be the innovative leader in the  provision of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Medical Services. This reflects the  department’s learning ideology; while This operates as a paramilitary organization  with strict command hierarchy, This also incorporates a seamless team environment  (i.e. all members are fully cross trained within each Division to sustain an efficient  flow of operations). Knowledge sharing is strongly encouraged, as is the  continuing educational and professional development of each and every  employee. Historical analysis proves this has always been a vital key to the  department’s growth, as evidenced in the following excerpt from a local  compilation, Sherwood Park, the First Twenty-five Years:   The credibility of the department has always been high. The  early emphasis on training and fire prevention, as well as on  fighting fires, may well have contributed significantly to the  high level of citizen and local government support enjoyed  by the department (Harrington, 1983, p. 67).   In 1995, SCES   followed SCES   goal of innovative leadership by piloting a  provincial 911 project through Telus and subsequently becoming the first official  provincial Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). It was also the first Emergency  Communications Centre in Canada to be registered with the International      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 12 - December  2010  Standards Organization (ISO)4. SCES   has subsequently added EMS, Rescue  and fire to SCES   ISO 9001 certification.  In 2009, in addition to Strathcona County  ,  SCES   was providing 911 call answer and  dispatch services to over 100  neighboring municipalities (equating to a population of approximately 500,000  Alberta residents) and fielded in excess of 60,000 E911 calls that year.   As a response to increased expectations and calls for service from several  stakeholders, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), large  industrial organizations such as oil refineries and upgraders and municipal  mutual aid partners, SCES   has in recent years also developed several specialty  teams.  These include a Technical Rescue Team (TRT), Water  Rescue Team   and Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services.    For further details on The SCES Management Team   as The SCES Management Team   appeared in 2009, please  see Appendix 4.   2.1 The SCES Management Team  Due to recent retirements, the entire  management team (Chief and Deputy Chiefs)  of SCES   has been replaced over the  previous four years. At the time of the first  retirement in 2005, The SCES Management Team  had an average of approximately eighteen  years of Chief Officer or Senior Manager  experience, with an average age of  approximately 54.  In 2009, The SCES Management Team   had an average of less than three  years of Chief Officer or Senior Manager  experience and an average age of 39. While  the incumbent Fire Chief had a total tenure of  seventeen years with SCES, none of the  Deputy Chiefs had longer than eight years of  service with the department, with one of the  Deputies having a military background, one  having a mixed municipal and industrial fire background, and one having a mixed   industrial emergency, disaster management and law enforcement background.                                                                4 “ISO certification is the basis of performance measurement throughout Europe and most other  industrialized countries” and “applies to both the design and provision” of services so registered   (SCES, 2009a).                                    Darrell Reid, Senior Manager  Chief  Strathcona County Emergency Services  Deputy Director,  2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 13 - December  2010  Although the previous administration had a greater depth of emergency  services training and experience, comparison of the past and present  management team yielded some differences in education levels.  Five years ago,  no Chief Officers at SCES   had a university degree of any kind; in 2009, the Fire  Chief and one Deputy Fire Chief have graduate degrees in business  administration, a second Deputy Chief has an applied degree in business and the incumbent Fire Chief is certified as a Canadian Emergency Manager (CEM) and  business continuity professional.  the Fire  Chief and one Deputy Fire Chief are also  registered paramedics, equaling three years of post-secondary education in  Alberta.  Many organizational and human resource outcomes were potentially  affected by the changes to the leadership of SCES  , including morale, staff  perception of leadership within the organization, staff perception of working  conditions and environment, attraction and retention of staff, job security,  succession planning, service delivery quality, and reputation of SCES   (Reid,  2009, p.10-12).   2.2 Other Considerations  On April 1, 2009, in conjunction  with the Alberta Government’s transition  of EMS funding and governance, SCES  entered into contract with Alberta Health  Services (AHS) to continue to provide  EMS service to Strathcona County and  the region. In addition to provision of  ambulance services, SCES   expanded SCES  Emergency Communications Centre in  2009 and entered into an agreement  with AHS to assist with the transition of  EMS dispatch into late 2010.  Under the terms of the AHS agreement, SCES   is required to ensure four  ambulances are always available for borderless regional coverage.  Balancing  incident resource requirements with contractual obligations during the height of  2009 North Strathcona Wildfire proved challenging to all involved. In addition, SCES   was also  obligated to respond to other incidents occurring within the municipality  simultaneous to the 2009 North Strathcona Fire. There was one occurrence in  particular where SCES   was required to mitigate a second wildland fire in the  southern area of Strathcona County   during this same time frame.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 14 - December  2010  Section B: Prevention Measures   Section B: Prevention Measures    looks at prevention measures and policies encouraged or  enforced in Strathcona   in an effort to prevent and  mitigate the effects of  wildfire on County lands and populations.        1. FireSmart:    Wildfires are a constituent of nature in forest, grassland, or even wetlands.   The issue some communities currently face is that human activity has increased  near and in natural areas over the last century, producing the Wildland   Interface (WUI).  The fuel load found in natural areas can burn at incredible rates  and temperatures, causing inconceivable damage.  In some areas where a fire  has not burned for many years, The fuel load found in these areas can be ignited by the smallest of  sources. This increases the risk of fires starting due to human activity and the  risk of structures being lost to fire damage.  According to Partners in   Protection (2010)5:   In the interface, successful fire protection cannot rely solely on  maintaining good fire control capability. To be successful, interface  stakeholders must implement a combination of appropriate  activities to raise awareness, reduce hazards, and plan for fire  occurrences (p.5).  To address this need, Partners in Protection has developed the FireSmart  Program, which provides valuable information to homeowners on ways to reduce  the impact of wildfire. By taking several preventative steps, residents can help  minimize potential damage to residents property.   1.1 Observations  Although Strathcona County Emergency Services (SCES) did promote the  FireSmart program before the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, such promotions were  limited.  FireSmart brochures were offered to each Strathcona County   resident  who applied for a fire permit, pamphlets were handed out at public events and  information on the  FireSmart program was made available through the County website.                                                               5 Partners in Protection is an Alberta-based coalition of multi-disciplinary professionals committed to  raising awareness [and] providing information… and practical tools for building FireSmart communities  (http:/ .partnersinprotection.ab.ca).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 15 - December  2010  1.2 Findings  The potential value of the  FireSmart program became sharply evident  during the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, when fire fighters faced the challenge of protecting “non- FireSmart:     homes. In 2010, in addition to handing out the FireSmart brochures  and providing information on the web, SCES   held three community information  sessions. three community information  sessions took place in April, 2010 in the communities of  Ardrossan, Josephburg and South Cooking Lake.       2. Fire Bans and Outdoor Burning Controls   Outdoor burning in Strathcona  is governed by the Emergency  Services Bylaw 68-2000, which  “establishes and provides for the  efficient operation of a fire and  ambulance service in Strathcona County  ”. Outdoor burning in Strathcona  County also regulates the “issuance  of fire permits, reporting of property  damaged by fire, control of fire hazards,  open fires, incinerator fires, pit fires,                          Signs purchased by SCES   to assist in timely  communication efforts with residents and visitors.   1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned:   FireSmart homes are more easily protected, thus reducing both  property and fire fighting costs.    Petroleum sites were at risk, but proper clearing using techniques  similar to FireSmart (i.e. set back requirements and industry  practices for environmental protection, emergency evacuation and  flaring) minimized damage to these facilities.  All natural and utility  resource corporations are commended on All natural and utility  resource corporations quick actions in  isolating gas and oil sources within the burn areas, which greatly  minimized the hazard   Stronger promotion of programs such as FireSmart in the various  Strathcona County communities has the potential to exponentially  reduce the impact of wildfire.         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 16 - December  2010  smudge fires and types of materials burned” (Strathcona County, 2010).  Fire  permits, which are required for any open or incinerator fires, can be obtained for  use on rural properties only, and are valid from date of approval to the end of  each calendar year. Prior to lighting any fire for which a permit is needed, the  permit-holder is required to call Emergency Service's 24-hour automated burning  information line as well as the wind speed line (as noted and provided on the  permit) to confirm that conditions allow for safe burning.   2.1 Observations  Prior to 2009, there was no formal standard established to determine  conditions under which fire hazards are assessed, evaluated and controlled in  Strathcona County.  Burning conditions were assessed and evaluated through an  estimated “best guess” of three different factors: wind speed, dryness and  availability of fire fighting resources. Control consisted of a recording on the  automated line that advised that burning either was or was not allowed at that  particular point in time.  Enforcement of controls was heavily dependent on a  “neighborhood watch” system; residents were urged to report any “improper”  burning to 911. Furthermore, although Bylaw 68-2000 authorized the issuance of  fines for contravention of permit regulations, SCES personnel preferred to view  any response to reports of improper burning as educational opportunities. In fact,  prior to 2008, the few fines that were issued were nominal and given out only at  the Fire Marshal’s discretion. The past two years, however, have seen a gradual  increase in both the number of fines issued and the amount assessed (which can  be as much as $1,000), sending a clear message to residents of a decreased  tolerance for permit infractions.  The authority to issue a full Fire Ban or suspend burning privileges is  derived through the Forest and Prairie Protection Act (RSA 2000, Chapter F-19,  Articles 4(3), 6(d), 7(1), 21 and 27). Beyond specifying how often and by what  means fire bans must be communicated to the public, however, the Act provides  little to no guidance on when, if, or how such authority should be invoked.  Due to  the labour intensive and costly protocols involved in instituting and  revoking a  full fire ban6, SCES   officials have been reluctant in the past to go to such lengths,  relying instead on the burning information line to inform residents of high fire risk  periods. In fact, prior to the summer of 2008, the last full fire ban for Strathcona  had been issued in the summer of 2002 despite the increasing fire risk  caused by the intervening six years of near-drought conditions.                                                                6 i.e. obtaining, setting up and taking down of numerous portable highway signs; preparing and issuing  approved media releases and public announcements; changing pre-recorded messages; etc.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 17 - December  2010  Since the 2009 North Strathcona Fire occurred in May of 2008, SCES   has  been far less reluctant to institute burning restrictions. In sharp contrast to past  practice, a total of four full fire bans were issued for Strathcona County   in the one  year period between May 2009 and 2010.  2.2 Findings:  Although research into standardized protocols for the issuance of fire bans  had been conducted prior to 2008, factors such as managerial and staff turnover,  coupled with drastic department growth and other considerations (i.e. the  provincial ambulance transfer) caused research into standardized protocols for the issuance of fire bans   to be overlooked and  relegated the implementation of such standards to a lesser priority.   In 2009, however, new research into standardized protocols was  undertaken.  This research, combined with a review of issues encountered in  issuing and revoking the fire ban the previous year, resulted in the creation of an  empirical fire ban matrix and standard protocols which were in place by April  2010 (Please see Appendix 5 for the complete SCES fire ban matrix).  While there is no evidence to suggest that issuance of a full fire ban may  have prevented the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, the 2009 North Strathcona Fire could be argued that SCES  would have been quicker to institute such controls if streamlined procedures and  clear protocols had previously been established. Issuance of a fire ban would, at  the very least, have resulted in increased awareness among residents of the  extreme fire risk, and possibly have reduced recreational use of the affected area  at the time.  These claims can be supported by the speed with which SCES   instituted a  second fire ban from September 24 to October 7, 2009, and the ease with which  Strathcona visitors and residents understood, accepted and complied.  It is also  not unreasonable to suggest that the increased number of “illegal fires” reported  to 911, as well as an increase in enquiries received by both 2117 and SCES  Administration on the subject of fire bans, fines and fire permits during this  period, reflected an increased awareness of burning control regulations among  Strathcona County residents and visitors.   It is interesting to note that SCES   was very quick to issue full fire bans in  2010 (first in April and again in May), after these refined standards and protocols                                                              7 211 is [a 24 hour] easy to remember telephone number that connects people to a full range of non- emergency social, health, and government services in the community   (http:/ .com  .php).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 18 - December  2010  were put into place. Of even more interest is the fact that, after experiencing  wildland fires of increasing magnitude for two years in a row, and despite  increased levels of fire risk, the north Strathcona area remained “fire-free”   in 2010.       2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   A number of factors can play a role in determining when a   fire ban is declared, including:    levels of both recent and total precipitation;    the risk of a fire getting out of control;    relation between temperature and humidity;    water restrictions or water bans; and     appropriate staffing and equipment availability   A Strathcona County Fire Ban Matrix has been developed to  incorporate all above considerations and provide a consistent,  evidence-based method of determining when a full fire ban   should be put into place.   A Standard Operating Policy (SOP) has been developed and  adopted by SCES   which clearly outlines procedures and   protocols to implement burning control measures in Strathcona County  . protocols have greatly reduced the ambiguity   and costs associated with invoking and revoking a full fire ban.     Erring on the side of caution and invoking a full fire ban sooner  rather than later raises awareness of fire risk and burning  regulations among residents, businesses and visitors of  Strathcona County. This in turn promotes community   participation in reduced fire hazards.           2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 19 - December  2010  Section C: Field Operations  Section C investigates all aspects of the response effort in the field during  the course of 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire, including the aspect of Emergency Social Services  (ESS) provided to evacuees. Data for this section was gathered through a review  of all SCES records relating to the incident, including dispatch transcripts, officer  narratives, reports from debriefings conducted with Mutual Aid, outside agencies  and other departments, as well as anecdotal accounts from various County  personnel.       1. Fire Suppression Efforts   On the afternoon of May 3, 2009 at 2:45 p.m. SCES crews were  dispatched to Township Road (TWP) 562 and west of Range Road (RR) 212 for  an outside fire.  Captain Nicholson, the initial officer on scene, reported two  distinct fires located on the east and west sides of Highway (Hwy) 830  discharging large columns of grey  smoke.    1.1 Observations:   Captain Nicholson and initial crews immediately began protecting  structures threatened on the east side of Hwy 830, north of TWP 564, and  established a staging area at the entry to Shiloh Ranch8.  Platoon Chief (PC)  Nixon was the next commanding officer on scene and directly began attacking  the wildland fire located on the West side of Hwy 830 in the area of RR 212 and  TWP 564.  At this point there were approximately 35 fire fighters from SCES  operating on the two fires.   On both sides of the highway, the fires  were supplied with extremely dry conditions and  relatively high winds. Mutual Aid Resources  were immediately requested, with the 2009 North Strathcona FireDepartments from Andrew, Edmonton, Dow  Chemicals, Shell Scotford, Fort Saskatchewan,  and Strathcona County   responding units to assist.   Bruderheim and Lamont County were not  available as Bruderheim and Lamont County were managing a portion of  the East fire in Bruderheim and Lamont County areas.                                                              8 Shiloh Ranch is a private youth ranch for disadvantaged children, run on a not-for-profit basis.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 20 - December  2010   Deputy Chiefs (DC) Jones and Elliott arrived on scene at approximately  4:00 p.m. as the requirement to escalate the response was apparent.  Jones and Elliott  assumed command of the East incident, Nixon assumed command of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) and Elliott assumed area command, supporting both incidents.   Concurrently, Fire Chief Darrell Reid was establishing the Department  Operations Centre (DOC) at Fire Station #1 and activating the Emergency  Operations Centre (EOC) in County Hall.  The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was also dispatched to the area at this time to provide  further command capability.   RCMP and fire resources commenced with a voluntary evacuation of  threatened residents, livestock and visitors to the area, a  popular motorized recreation vehicle spot.  Although effective evacuation was  achieved for acreage residents in the first few hours, there were challenges in  removing recreation vehicle operators from the scene.  There were also certain  challenges in assisting agricultural residents with evacuation of livestock. Further  details on the Emergency Social Services (ESS) aspect of the response are  contained in segment 2 of this section.   Concurrently, the utilities and energy  companies who operate pipelines, power  lines, and petroleum sites  in the area  were contacted to provide expertise in  isolating risks from these hazards.  The  Salvation Army was also dispatched to  ensure evacuated residents were cared for,  and to provide meals for emergency  responders.   Fire suppression efforts utilized by fire fighters and officers were basic  wildland  interface controls, using water to wet down fire areas, manual  labor to excavate ground fires, and structure protection measures.  Fire suppression efforts utilized by fire fighters and officersproved rather effective, but very labor intensive for the duration of the day and  early evening operations on May 3.  At 22:20 hrs, the work completed on both  fires over the previous seven hours was beginning to prove successful.  Crews  were able to regroup and overhaul was initiated on both  fires over the previous seven hours.  The EOC was  discontinued and by 01:00 hrs on May 4, most mutual aid resources had been  released.  Area Command was assigned to Platoon Chief (PC) Sutton, west  command consisted of two brush trucks and one tanker unit doing roving patrols      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 21 - December  2010  for overhaul, and the east command consisted of one squad, one tanker, and  one brush truck also doing roving patrols for overhaul.    Unfortunately, the early morning of  May 4 produced winds gusting to 50 km   from the west, which started large flare ups  as the 2009 North Strathcona Fire was pushed into high fuel loads.   At 03:00 hrs the 2009 North Strathcona Fire was deemed out  of control in several areas due to the fact  that crews were finding it difficult to travel  in the wildland areas in darkness.     At dawn the high winds and  temperature hindered firefighting efforts and both  fires over the previous seven hours flared up again.  The main  issue with fire growth was structure protection as more buildings were being  threatened.  The majority of the effort on May 4 was spent in trying to protect  homes, secure heavy equipment such as bulldozers with operators for building  effective fire breaks and organizing command with multiple public and private  agencies.  Provincial Sustainable Resources Development (SRD), Forestry  Division, was able to immediately provide three air tanker groups that could drop  a total of over 40,000 liters of fire retardant.   Even though this air support found  operations difficult due to the size of the 2009 North Strathcona Fire, there was some reprieve observed.  In  addition to the air support, Alberta SRD  approved a request from both Lamont and  Strathcona County to provide ground  support and approximately 90 SRD and  SRD contract employees were deployed to  Heartland Hall (Fire Station #4).   May 5 maintained similar weather patterns with ever changing gusting  winds and increased temperature with decreased humidity.  After 48 hours of  extraordinary fire growth and even greater fire suppression efforts, 130 fire  fighters, two air tanker groups, three bulldozer groups with three bulldozers per  group, and a number of mutual aid resources were still working on restricting fire  movement and protecting structures.     Although Mutual Aid Partners were released by the end of the first week,  SCES fire fighters, Contractors and SRD crews continued to battle 2009 North Strathcona Wildfireover the next two months with varying success.  By the end of May, total fire      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 22 - December  2010  costs were estimated to be in excess of  $834,000.  Factors unrelated to the actual  response also hindered Factors unrelated to the actual  response efforts.  Interference from ATV operators in the  area increased to a level that forced Alberta SRD  crews to relocate their base of operations.  At this point, SCES closed the area to all  non-essential traffic and recreational use.  This restriction remained in effect until The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was deemed officially over.     During the last week of May, SRD crews began a formal demobilization,  but maintained a presence at the scene, operating from SRD crews temporary base  located near Station #4, Heartland Hall.  Throughout the month of June, both  SRD and SCES crews continued to search out and deal with troublesome  hotspots. These patrols continued until 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire was  officially declared extinguished on Friday, July 3, nearly ten weeks after the initial  call to 911.    For a detailed timeline of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP), please see Appendix 6.    1.2 Findings:  a) Command and Coordination   Command coordination was in place for the first 72 hours, but challenges  with control were lacking in several areas.  The scope of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) required a  larger command structure than typically utilized by SCES.  Area Command was  established at the onset with two separate commands reporting for day one;  however, there was some confusion on this organization of command in the  subordinate levels reporting to the separate East and West commands.      This was rectified at the start of day two, with Area Command and two  subordinate geographic commands being abolished and replaced by a single  Command, Operations Section and Divisions  being established as  necessary. On day three, command became unified with SRD with Deputy  Section Chiefs established as required.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 23 - December  2010  As stated, control over outside agencies was lacking. Having mutual aid  resources available was a definite benefit, but the size and intensity of the  wildfire coupled with challenges in communication produced a risk for mutual aid  resources available.     Self-deployed resources were also a definite issue.  Research has shown  that this type of “emergent activity” is common in disaster situations.  Invariably,  there is a convergence of resources into the affected community, a “‘mass  assault’ of independent and decentralized activity” (Perry, 1991, p.202; Wenger,  1992, p.3; Scawthorn and Wenger, 1990, p2-3; Auf der Heide, 1989, p.75;  Wenger et.al., 1987, p.20 as cited in Drabek & McEntire, 2003, p.100). Often,  “groups … emerge to begin automatically responding to the needs of one  another” without official sanction (Fischer, 2002, p.124). During times of  community crisis, self-deployed or “emergent groups” represent “a potential  source of knowledge, funds, equipment, and human resources” that may be  critical to response or recovery efforts (Wachtendorf, 2001, p.11). On the other  hand, as the other  hand commonly operate independent of traditional authority, such  groups also have the potential of further disrupting response efforts that may  already be strained (Fowler, 2008, p.1).  One particular instance during the  2009 North Strathcona Fire supports this  claim. A private corporation took the initiative  to provide assistance that was not officially  sanctioned. Although this company provides  an excellent service, this company does so at an elevated  cost. In addition to escalated costs, because  this company did not coordinate this company efforts  through area command, this company not only created  a potential duplication of effort, this company also lacked access to information that could  have been critical to the safety of this company own resources. In other words, by not  placing themselves under the established unified command, themselves became  another “uncontrollable element in the response milieu whose appearance …  [created] complications for security and site safety” (Kendra & Wachtendorf,  2002, p.138).   b) Communications   Communications, always an issue in emergent situations, presented  several challenges during The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP). several challenges, however, helped 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 24 - December  2010  only identify some important deficiencies within SCES current radio system, but  also identify possible solutions through a unique opportunity to test new  technology introduced through the collaboration of two of Strathcona County Emergency Services - 24 - December  2010   vendors.     In the past, radio communication to the northern area of Strathcona  County has consistently proven ineffective, due mainly to the height and  coverage of the radio tower in the Heartland area.  A new radio system had been  purchased and put into operations approximately one year prior, which greatly  reduced this deficiency; however, A new radio system was still being dealt with at the time the 2009  North fire occurred.    During this time frame, SCES, in partnership with Westcan  Communication Services and Motorola, was conducting the first-in-the-world test  of 4.9 Ghz technology.  the  2009 North Strathcona Fire provided the unexpected  opportunity to field-test newly-developed bridging radio technology used as part  of the trial. The bridge provides the user with the ability to “link” two different  radio systems, giving the separate users the ability to speak with one another  using the separate users own radio equipment. There were challenges using a new system “on  the fly”, but a new system did display some promise for future operations. In addition to the  bridging technology, Westcan   provided emergency radio assistance, portable  towers and radio-coverage monitoring and service.  Another communication challenge involved mutual aid and external auto- deployed resources. With a finite number of SCES radios and personnel, it was  difficult to assign either to external parties.  At times, mutual aid resources were  held back because SCES Command had no method of communicating with  mutual aid resources. Although cell phones filled this gap to a certain extent, this solution was far  from ideal. A more effective solution was demonstrated in the deployment of an  Edmonton Fire Battalion Chief to the SCES Incident Command Post (ICP).  During the first 24 hours, this officer became the main point of communication  between the Edmonton contingent and the area commander, promoting a swift  and seamless transfer of crucial information between the two parties.  c) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources  Re-evaluation of fuel packets did occur at regular intervals with crews and  resources requested and assigned as needed to protect the various well-heads  and properties in the northern area of Strathcona  County. A more efficient use of mutual aid resources,  however, could have been instituted.  Requests for mutual aid assistance were  “bunched” too closely together and as a result, resources were not evenly  available or dispersed across operational periods.  In fact, at times, it was      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 25 - December  2010  discovered that mutual aid resources had been deemed surplus and released, as  opposed to being staged and ready, just as the situation changed and the need  for mutual aid resources became apparent.   Accountability for tracking team members was also problematic; it was not  always maintained and teams did not always preserve group cohesion. This  accountability issue was further confounded among external teams by  unfamiliarity, not only with department-specific terminology but also with local  geography. These challenges were alleviated to some degree by the use of the  Incident Command System (ICS) and the inclusion of the Edmonton Fire  Battalion Chief in incident command as mentioned previously in this section.    In fact, this suggests a solution that  could have been easily expanded to  integrate all mutual aid and county  resources: divide field staff into “joint”  teams; for example, group two SCES  personnel with two mutual aid personnel.  This not only addresses communication  issues by providing each team with  compatible radio technologies and  common terminology, This also addresses  geographical concerns. Furthermore, This ensures a “vested” interest within each  team. Perhaps most importantly of all, however, such blended crews represent  an increased ability to meet obligations with regard to crew safety.    d) Safety and Accountability  To address issues noted above, a system of tracking resources and tracking resources  location was developed and implemented within the first 72 hours.  Based on ICS  principles, a system of tracking resources and their  location provided a consistent daily overview of who was on duty,  what roles or functions were assigned and  performed and any safety issues  encountered.   SCES also employed SCES traditional  system of tracking employees using  accountability tags attached to a “board”.  accountability tags attached to a “board are assigned to each member at  the commencement of accountability tags attached to a “board career with  SCES, a system used in many departments  throughout North America. Although this      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 26 - December  2010  system has proven efficient in smaller events, Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 26 - December  2010  system use on a significant incident  with multiple fronts proved far more challenging. As well, the accountability of  external resources was identified as being less than adequate   at times.   Safety and accountability was a particular issue in the first two days of the  event.  Crews were worked extremely hard for extended hours with little to no  rehabilitation scheduled. Crews that initially responded to The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) had been  on duty since 06:00 hrs that morning, but were held by necessity on the  fireground until approximately 23:00 hrs that night. Not only did this increase the  risk of error or injury, this also revealed a serious flaw in the planning process; a  reactive rather than proactive mentality which gave little thought towards what  resources SCES had in reserve for the future or left in place for day to day  operations. SCES human resource profile at the onset of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was lean.  Fire officers and fire fighters faced an ever changing event with an ever changing  roster of part time fire fighters, mutual aid and external, auto-deployed resources.  In fact, at one point, staffing pressures caused recruits still in staffing pressures orientation  period to be called into active duty. Although Occupational Health and Safety  (OHS) Codes require such members to be under the direct supervision of a  competent worker, this was not always the case.     SCES, however, prides SCES on the direction of safety in the station and  on the fireground.  Within the first 24 hours of the  event, the issue of time and  resource management was brought forward and addressed.  Over the next two  days, one person was assigned the duty of better organizing personnel.  Consistent, scheduled shifts of eight to ten hours were established for fire  fighters on an overtime basis to ensure regular shifts were not impacted. At the  onset, the shifts consisted of eight to twelve fire fighters with officers; as the  event decelerated, shifts of two to six fire fighters were established.  This proved  useful as the mode turned to the overhaul stage.  Fire fighters were able to  respond to smaller incidents in the region while SRD provided support for  ongoing wildland firefighting in the north.    Personnel Accountability Report (PAR) checks were also completed at  every shift, however, this was done on a sporadic basis at best; units and groups  were largely left to units and groups   own devices.  Although a rudimentary sign-in procedure  was used at the Incident Command Post (ICP) in an attempt to track mutual aid  and private resources, a more formalized process would definitely have enabled  more efficient coordination and accountability of resources. Daily Safe Work  Plans, establishing pertinent hazards, controls and procedures to mitigate      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 27 - December  2010  hazards and risk also provide better risk management for larger events of longer  duration. This is a common SRD practice that has since been adopted by SCES.     Fortunately, only two relatively minor injuries were reported during the  entire event, and both involved external personnel.  This is an important statistic,  considering that the size and scope of the  event was beyond anything the  department had encountered in the past.    e) Incident Command System (ICS) Utilization    Although, as mentioned previously, ICS principles were employed to track  accountability and safety, the ICS hierarchical structure, itself, was not developed  at a pace appropriate to incident progression. Several vital roles were not filled  until serious issues were encountered.  A delay in appointing Staging and  Logistics Officers, for example, caused a delay in the establishment of a staging  area distinct and separate from the camp area set aside for food, rest and  maintenance breaks. This created several points of confusion. Arriving resources  had no clear reporting point and had difficulty checking in. Staged resources  mingled with those out of service and were then not readily available for  deployment. Having Staging and Logistics Officers in place immediately ensures  an early ability to track and move the right resources to the right place at the right  time. Moreover, through the early establishment of separate, distinct and  supervised staging and camp areas, the right resources are usually physically  located where the right resources are expected to be.    Another ICS role that would have  dramatically increased operational  efficiency is the Officer “Scribe”.  Scribes  can greatly facilitate information transfer  and buffer Scribes   officers from unnecessary  interruption. More importantly, Scribes    enable a thoroughly detailed and accurate  incident progression record for later  analysis and cost recovery applications.       f) Logistics  Apart from issues noted in previous sections, the major logistical  challenges faced in The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) dealt either with food and water provision for  responders and evacuees, or identification and management of vendors and  contractors for required resources.   Location of command post, day 1.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 28 - December  2010  In order to meet the obligation of ensuring adequate provision for  evacuees and responders, SCES called in the Salvation Army to provide food  support from the initial onset throughout the first month of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP), with some  assistance from Shell Scotford’s catering service. As the event proceeded, a  number of helpful residents also sought to assist in this regard, but with  questionable results.  As in any situation where food is provided on a  “commercial” or “public” basis, food is crucial to ensure that the providers meet  Alberta Health Requirements.  This is generally done through a rigorous  inspection of the preparation process, which is not always possible when food is  prepared off-site or in non-professional kitchens.  For this reason, food offerings  were not always received in the spirit in which food offerings   were given.  In fact, in one  particular instance, a complaint was made that SCES fire fighters had refused or  thrown food away, untouched, in front of the donors who had brought a complaint. a complaint was investigated, but due to a lack of recorded evidence, a complaint was  impossible to determine the exact details. Fortunately, this appears to have been  an isolated episode, but nevertheless, SCES personnel were instructed to be  more circumspect in future.   In addition to issues revolving around food preparation, there were also  challenges with how it was distributed and to whom.  To address hygiene issues  in the field, handwash stations at eating or catering areas could have ensured  decreased cross contamination. With regard to distribution issues, a system of  meal tickets (with accompanying instructions on where and how to use them)  could have provided better controls on actual food consumption.  A second major logistical challenge  dealt with the identification and  management of vendors and contractors for  other required resources, such as bull  dozers and sanitation equipment (porta  potties).  It was sometimes difficult to  differentiate between officially contracted  and “emergent” (self-deployed) resources.   Required information, such as Occupational  Health and Safety (OHS) and Worker Compensation Board (WCB) compliance,  or details on billing and service agreements, was not always provided.  As well,  verification and  tracking of actual services rendered proved lacking at times.   Several solutions for these issues were suggested during the debriefing  sessions.  One of the most practical was the creation of a “Pre-approved Vendor  List”, a list of contractors and vendors who have agreed to provide necessary      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 29 - December  2010  resources at a pre-negotiated price during emergency events.  This would ensure  provision of resources that are properly trained and compatible within the  guidelines of SCES operations as well as a full understanding of vendor  processes and expectations before the contracted work is undertaken.   In addition to the Approved Vendor list, a proper check-in  system,  such as a time clock, could ensure proper tracking controls are in place. An  official system of identification, such as magnetic door logos for official contractor  vehicles, is also needed to clearly differentiate An  official system of identification, such as magnetic door logos for official contractor  vehicles from self-deployed  resources.  These solutions not only address the need for timely provision of  appropriate resources and responsible financial oversight, but also increase site  safety and security.     g) Situational Awareness   Initial size-up and strategies involved in dealing with two concurrent  wildfires was difficult with limited human resources.  As well, the sheer size of the  area, coupled with topographical features such as heavy brush and limited sight- lines, impeded the rapid collection of accurate and comprehensive intelligence at  ground level.  These difficulties were quickly resolved once aerial  reconnaissance had been obtained and Strathcona County’s Geographic  Information Systems (GIS) Department began plotting the data onto meaningful  and detailed maps.    h) Planning and Training    Deficiencies and challenges were also noted in the areas of planning and  training.  One major deficiency lay in the fact that although the SCES portion of  the County’s Emergency Response Plan was up to date in electronic draft  format, this information had not yet been made official or shared with key  personnel in hard copy format as per normal process. As a result,  the County’s Emergency Response Plan was  found lacking when put into play and valuable time was wasted in re-gathering  crucial information.     One major deficiency is a common issue in emergency management. Although  research suggests more emphasis should be placed on the planning process  than the plan, itself (Wachtendorf and Kendra, 2006), this does not always  happen. It can be difficult for staff facing other work demands, to justify spending  the necessary time preparing and planning for something that may never happen  (Fowler, 2008).  To address this issue, SCES piloted a Strathcona County  Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) in January 2010, 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 30 - December  2010  and focus is to redesign and improve the County’s existing emergency  management and business continuity plans and processes.     Also related to a planning deficiency was the fact that SCES did not have  personnel with Dozer Boss Training for constructing proper dozer (fire) guards.  This is a tactic strongly recommended and used by SRD.  Having properly  trained staff right at the outset can drastically and immediately restrict fire  extension.  Not having this capability for the first two days severely limited SCES’  ability to complete an early, efficient strategic fire containment.  Since The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP), Strathcona County   has trained and certified six Strathcona County  employees in proper dozer guard construction tactics.    1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Utilizing water and basic manual labor for protection of structures  was appropriate, but proved ineffective for restricting fire growth in  large wildland  fires. Early acquisition of heavy equipment with  trained operators for constructing proper fire breaks would provide  increased efficiency in fire suppression efforts.     Smooth communication with and integration of mutual aid resources  proved challenging. The standard and consistent use of “blended”  crews could not only address communication and safety issues, but  also ensure the existence of a “vested” interest in all fire fighting  teams.    Control and coordination of self deployed resources (emergent  activity or groups) can also become a challenge in large incidents.    A consistent system and process, such as a pre-approved vendor  list, can facilitate identification and  coordination of unauthorized  activity into the authorized response.    A pre-approved vendor list and contracting system for heavy  equipment also ensures provision of resources that are properly  trained and compatible within the guidelines of SCES operations   and prior full understanding of vendor processes and expectations.    OHS obligations require that recruits who have not completed  OHS obligationsorientation period be under the direct supervision of a competent  worker at all times. Such supervision, however, may not always be  feasible. Where resource needs require the deployment of such  inexperienced recruits, Where resource needs roles should be limited to those which  do not put Where resource needs at risk (i.e. aide  duties, logistical support,  rehabilitation or medical monitoring).  continued next page      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 31 - December  2010    1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned (cont’d)   Fire crews working extended hours with little to no scheduled  rehabilitation increases the risk of error or injury.  Food provision   and rest break coordination must be considered a critical aspect   of incident planning.   The Incident Command System (ICS) is “a proven management  system based on successful business practices and is the result of  decades of lessons learned in the organization and management   of emergency incidents” (City of Edmonton Office of Emergency  Preparedness, 2009, p.9). Building the “bench strength” of  Strathcona County within ICS would ensure ICS is used to full   extent and that ICS hierarchical structure is developed at a pace  appropriate to incident progression.   Initial size up and strategies involved in dealing with two concurrent  fires was difficult with limited human resources.  The acquisition of  air support during initial onset can provide rapid, accurate and  comprehensive intelligence gathering. This facilitates the early  development of effective incident action plans and swifter  implementation of appropriate strategy and tactics.     Basic mapping of wildland areas should be employed from the  onset of the event.  Strathcona County   has an extremely robust  GIS department that is very competent in providing excellent maps  with great detail and information.   The lack of officers assigned to Planning and Logistics roles at the  scene from initial onset caused delay in mitigation actions.  Having  these roles assigned early relieves the pressure on the Incident  Commander, allowing the Incident  Commander to focus on long term strategy rather  than immediate tactics and provides for better situational  awareness.    Although more emphasis should be placed on the planning  process, it can be difficult for staff facing other work demands to  justify spending the necessary time. To address this issue, SCEShas created the Strathcona County   Emergency Management  Agency (SCEMA) pilot project, whose focus is to redesign and  improve the Strathcona County  ’s existing emergency management process.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 32 - December  2010  2. Emergency Social Services (ESS)  Information for the following segment was provided by Family and  Community Services (FCS) Department through a review of Family and  Community Services (FCS) Department records,  debriefs and anecdotal accounts.    2.1 Observations  To provide for residents and visitors responding to the voluntary  evacuation of the area called for on the afternoon of May 3, a Reception Centre  was opened at the Moyer Recreation Centre in Josephberg around 19:00 hours  that same evening. The role of Reception Centre Manager was initially filled by  Emergency Services personnel, although an FCS Coordinator and Supervisor  were immediately dispatched to the facility. Upon arrival, the two FCS staff  assisted the SCES Captain, Fire Prevention & Investigation and the SCES Public  Safety Education & Marketing Specialist in preparing a Reception Centre   to  receive evacuees.   Volunteer resources from the Salvation Army were already at work  preparing food in anticipation of potential demand9. Volunteer resources from the Salvation Army operated  independently in a self-contained unit, but remained under the direction of the  Reception Centre Manager. RCMP Victim Services volunteers also arrived at   a Reception Centre   later that evening to assist with supportive counseling   for evacuees.   On May 4, following a clarification of roles, FCS staff assumed the role of  Reception Centre Manager, leaving SCES personnel to deal with any media who  might arrive at   the Moyer Centre. Victim Services volunteers were directed to act as  liaison between any evacuees wanting to return to Victim Services volunteers homes and the RCMP  who could escort Victim Services volunteers there. When   the Moyer Centre was open to the public, a  Recreation Parks and Culture (RPC) staff member was always present to assist  with access issues and answer questions pertaining to facility details.  FCS staff  members worked in two to four member teams, depending on the time of day; a  total of six different FCS staff participated throughout the course of the event.    From May 4th to May 9th (when the EOC was also stood down),   the Moyer Centre was opened on a daily basis between 09:00 hours and 19:00 /  20:00 hours, when direction to close was received from the EOC. Contact was  maintained between the Reception Centre and the ESS Manager in the EOC via  cell phone.                                                               9The food was later redeployed to the incident staging area when evacuees failed to materialize.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 33 - December  2010  During this time period, only two evacuees registered at   the Moyer Centre, and  neither chose to remain.  Other visitors included the Elected Official for the area,  the Community Liaison Officer and a health inspector who arrived on the second  day to examine the kitchen facilities and discuss food distribution with Reception  Centre staff.  Media also came to the site on three separate occasions asking to  speak with evacuees.    2.2 Findings  The authority to call for an evacuation (on either a voluntary or mandatory  basis) during a declared State of Local Emergency is derived through the  Emergency Management Act (RSA 2000, Chapter E-6.8, Article 19 [1, g]). Along  with this authority, however, comes a responsibility to “make arrangements for  the adequate care and protection of those persons or livestock …” (p.13).     The establishment of a Reception Centre   addressed this obligation;  however, there was initial confusion over which County department was  responsible for this aspect of the response. Despite FCS’ predetermined role as  the provider of Emergency Social Services (ESS) in Strathcona County  , SCESpersonnel continued to manage a Reception Centre   that first evening. This was  due in part to the fact that SCES initiated the set up, had better access to current  information and more familiarity with emergency situations. FCS staff   initially  dispatched had prior training, but little experience in such an operation and  therefore deferred to SCES personnel. Further confusion ensued with the arrival  of Victim Services volunteers, as they, too, appeared uncertain of they role and  from whom they should take direction.  Although the issue was quickly resolved,  the issue highlights a need for further clarification, training and practice with regard to  Emergency Social Service (ESS) roles, expectations and responsibilities.  A second deficiency noted in ESS operations for The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was the fact  that the \"Emergency Kit\" (forms, supplies, etc) thought to be stored at one of the  Fire Halls no longer existed; The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) was also unclear who would have been  responsible for bringing the kit out to a Reception Centre   if the kit had existed. To  address this gap, FCS staff at   the Moyer Centre began \"developing forms\" in anticipation  of arriving evacuees. The lack of other on-hand supplies10, however, meant that  the obligation to provide adequate care for evacuees beyond the provision of  shelter, food and water could not have been met immediately, although access to  any required item was available if the need arose.                                                               10 i.e. reading material, activities, spare clothing, hygienic items, diapers, etc.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 34 - December  2010  This experience generated a significant amount of conversation among  FCS staff regarding preparedness and needs for such an event. With assistance  from the pilot Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA), FCS’ has already  addressed the issue. In the first six months of 2010, Alberta Emergency  Management Agency (AEMA) facilitated training courses for both FCS and  SCEMA staff were conducted on ICS, ESS and Registry & Enquiry (R&I) Centre  operations.  In addition to the courses, the department (in conjunction with  SCEMA) ran a mock disaster exercise in the fall of 2010 to provide their staff an  opportunity to gain experience and confidence in practicing these newly   acquired skills.     2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Clarification, training and practice with regard to Emergency Social  Service (ESS) roles, expectations and responsibilities is crucial to  the efficient operation of a Reception and  R&I Centre during an  emergent event. FCS’, in conjunction with the pilot SCEMA, is  already in the process of addressing this situation.    Access to a sufficient supply of forms, lists of needed office supplies,  and other basic necessities is equally crucial to the efficient  operation of a Reception Centre. The preparation of adequate  emergency kits beforehand can not only ensure adequate provision  for evacuees, but also reduces stress levels among workers. This,   in turn, creates a more calming and hospitable environment for all,  an important goal in an already anxiety-provoking situation.            2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 35 - December  2010  Section D – The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)  Section D examines the activities of municipal officials and County  administration working in the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to support  field operations    1. EOC Operation  Data on the efficient  operation of a Reception Centre,  performance and staffing of the EOC  was gathered in the following manner.  On September 30, 2009, an EOC  Debrief was conducted by SCES.  Over  the four days preceding an EOC  Debrief,  telephone surveys were individually  conducted with County Staff who were  identified from the EOC registration  sheets. telephone surveys were designed to assess staff comfort with telephone surveys roles and  responsibilities within the EOC environment, the effectiveness of communication  within the EOC  , provide overall feedback on telephone surveys experience and generate  suggestions for improvement. A summary of survey findings was used to  stimulate thought and generate further discussion at the formal debriefing  session.  The remainder of this Section deals with information so gathered.  1.1  Observations  In late afternoon of May 3 as the magnitude of the 2009 North Strathcona  Wildfire first became apparent, the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was  activated in Conference Centre #1, County Hall, only to be stood down shortly  after midnight when conditions appeared to indicate the 2008 North Strathcona Fire was under control.  Several hours later, when the winds increased and the 2008 North Strathcona Fire became evident that this  assumption was incorrect, the EOC was reopened and remained opened for the  duration of that week (to May 9, 2009).  the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was also run in conjunction with the EOC on  various occasions during that same week.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 36 - December  2010  1.2 Findings:  a) The initial response   In keeping with lessons learned from the 2008 North Strathcona Fire, the EOC was opened at an early stage of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP). An overly optimistic analysis  of the situation, however, led to the erroneous conclusion that the EOC was  redundant long before a true sense of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) had been obtained.  Ironically,  although this decision was no doubt influenced by a natural desire to minimize  inconvenience to EOC staff and maximize operational efficiency, this decision had exactly  the opposite effect to that intended.   b) Command Coordination and ICS  As mentioned previously, the EOC and the DOC were run in conjunction  from two separate locations during the initial week of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP). Running two  simultaneous operations centres, however, has the potential to create confusion  and does not follow proper ICS Chain of Command ideology. Ideally, the EOC  should run the entire event with the DOC element physically represented within  the same location. This avoids duplication of effort and delayed access to  important and often time sensitive information.    c) Communications  Overall, survey respondents and debrief participants felt that  communication within the EOC (i.e. about the event, assigned tasks, feedback on  tasks, etc.) was effective. The on time, regular “as promised” briefings, in  particular, were cited by participants as a major positive process.   One or two areas of concern, however, were identified by Legislative and  Legal Services (LLS), the department responsible to keep a record of the actions  and decisions made in the course of the emergency. Oftentimes, these  representatives were not able to capture these points, either because these  representatives were  not included in key conversations or were physically located too far away from  ‘the action’ to hear the discussions. According to one participant: “Relying on  overheard conversations is not conducive to good recordkeeping, yet that is often  the way we were able to capture anything”.  Adding to this concern was the fact that the EOC forms intended to  capture a decision or action were not consistently completed and  provided to  LLS. Accurate and timely completion and provision of these forms would 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 37 - December  2010  provide a more complete historical record of the event, 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire would also greatly  enhance the accuracy and completeness of the regular briefings provided to  participants as The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) progressed.  One suggestion for improvement  generated during the debriefing was to provide these forms and briefings in an  electronic format.  an  electronic format would allow all participants to access updated  information at all participants convenience and to communicate asynchronously to avoid  unnecessary workflow disruptions.   an  electronic format would necessitate access to the County’s email and  document management system within the EOC, which was another suggestion  for improvement generated from the debrief session.  It was felt that such access  would encourage staff whose offices are located within County Hall, to remain at  whose offices station in the EOC rather than returning to whose offices desks to check on day to  day tasks.  Such absences have not only the potential to delay or interrupt EOC  workflow, but can also create a secondary disruptive effect in the form of  extraneous conversation or “bustle” as staff members enter or leave the room.    One participant reported “there was a sense that if you left the EOC for  any length of time, you needed to catch up quickly” (SCES, 2009).  Provision of  regular bulleted points of development and updates on the outside world, as well  as a “daily summary” at shift changes, was one learning identified that helped to  provide direction and avoid duplication of work and unnecessary interruptions of  other staff.  It is also important to ensure that all visitors and staff in the EOC are  aware of communication and confidentiality protocols.  d) Staffing and Integration of Mutual Aid Resources  Initial staffing for the EOC  was composed of the Chief  Commissioner in his role as  Director of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)Management and key personnel  from SCES, Corporate Planning &  Intergovernmental Affairs (CPIA)  and Communications, the three  departments most impacted at the  onset of The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP). As The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) progressed, The Strathcona County Incident  Command Post (ICP) became  evident that support from other departments would be required. Staff from  Legislative and Legal Services (LLS), Transportation and Agriculture Services  (TAS) and Information Technology Services (ITS) were called in on May 4 to fill      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 38 - December  2010  the roles previously established for their respective departments through the  Strathcona County Emergency Preparedness Plan.  In addition to internal County  Staff, a representative from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency  (AEMA) was also in attendance to provide a link to related activities happening  simultaneously in other neighboring jurisdictions.  Overall, survey and debrief results indicated that “virtually everyone felt  survey and debrief results knew survey and debrief results roles” although there was some confusion “caused by people  being asked to perform unaccustomed tasks”.  some confusion “caused by people  being asked to perform unaccustomed tasks” appeared directly  related to the fact that not all staff in attendance had had previous experience  working in the EOC environment and were thus unsure of the expectations  associated with their assigned role (SCES, 2009). One suggestion to ensure role  competency is to institute a competency “sign-off” for EOC roles.    e) Safety and Accountability  One problem noted within EOC operations was inadequate security and  identification of authorized EOC personnel. The current location of the EOC is  too accessible to the outside world (i.e. large windows) and does not effectively  balance security with access.   As well, although a well-established registration process (and provision of  ID tags for EOC participants) does exist, it was not followed consistently, which  resulted in an incomplete registration record of EOC participants. This came to  light during the debrief, when several County Staff members questioned why several County Staff members  had not been invited to participate in the survey although several County Staff members had been part of  EOC operations.    Several participants also reported having issues with people “wandering  in” or “hanging out” in the EOC longer than was strictly necessary. Others  commented on the lack of a clear process on getting information into or out of the EOC with a minimum of interruption. One participant questioned whether or not  EOC operations conformed to the County’s Occupational Health and Safety  Rules on working alone.    One suggested solution to these issues was to create an “EOC Security  Officer ” role. The presence of the Security Officer could not only serve to  discourage and reduce unauthorized and  unnecessary “visitors”, but could  also facilitate timely contact with the right person at the right time.  This position  could be staffed from any department; This position   is one opportunity for people from other  departments to fill non-command roles and increase people from other  departments comfort level with the  inner workings of an EOC.      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 39 - December  2010  f) Logistics  Of all operational aspects,  the logistical set-up of the EOC  generated the most discussion.  Although many participants  commented on the calm,  supportive and respectful  environment that existed during  the EOC   operation, several critical  technological and physical gaps  were identified:    Technological Gaps   Existing processes and procedures don’t support new technology   GIS and mapping tools located within the EOC are seriously outdated   Inadequate access to basic office equipment such as photocopiers,  printers and faxes   Inadequate capacity for laptop networking and connections   Antiquated phone system   No support TV  monitor for live news feeds or contact with outside  events  Physical gaps:   Set up of room is dictated by antiquated phone system and is not the best  use of space:   busiest departments (i.e. SCES, RCMP, Fleet and Communications)  are all located in one corner of the room   set up of room was confusing, cramped with blocked sight-lines   desks facing the wall not conducive to feeling of “inclusiveness”   No “break-out” rooms or “living environment” for night time operations  or food  breaks   No clear floor plan provided to reduce set up time    No floor plan and  schedule provided outside the room   to clearly identify  positions and roles. This has since been addressed by the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA).   Confusion over what information and  tools should be kept in  Department EOC kits and who is responsible to update same        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 40 - December  2010  g) Planning, Training and Preparedness  Another suggestion on increasing comfort levels in the various EOC roles  and expectations, or in other words, on overcoming the “EOC Mystique”, was to  encourage “uninvolved” staff to visit and observe the EOC in action. This solution  is problematic, however, as This solution   runs directly counter to the need (as discussed in  the previous section) of discouraging and reducing unauthorized and   unnecessary “visitors”.  Furthermore, as research into best practices indicates  that ICS is becoming the national standard for handling emergency situations in  both Canada and the United States, future Strathcona EOC activations will be  transitioning towards an ICS-based operation. This will necessitate that all  potential EOC staff must have, at the very least, a basic understanding of ICS  organization, basic terminology and the common responsibilities associated with  ICS assignments.   A more realistic solution would therefore be to provide appropriate  training, reinforced through practical application of this new skill set by means of  table-top and mock disaster exercises. In keeping with this latter, more practical  solution, a new ICS and EOC training program has already been initiated through  the SCEMA pilot previously mentioned. As of the date of Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services -, over 100  staff members have already participated in this new training program and are  now certified at the ICS 100 (introductory) level.     1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   the EOC should be opened earlier than later in an emergent situation,  and kept open on a continuous basis until the EOC is certain that the incident  is and will remain under control   the EOC should encompass the DOC as opposed to running two  operations centres in conjunction at separate locations. The the EOC  should run the entire event with the DOC element physically  represented within the same location. This avoids duplication of effort  and delayed access to important and often time sensitive information.     Have forms and briefings available electronically   Have County email and document management systems available at  all EOC workstations to relieve day to day work pressures   Provide regular bulleted points of development and updates on the  outside world.  continued next page      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 41 - December  2010      1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned (cont’d)   Provide a daily summary brief at each shift change   Ensure all visitors and staff are aware of communication and  confidentiality protocols   Involve more departments in initial EOC staffing to ensure  continuity and more accurate historical record keeping   Provide a “heads up” to departments who may need to play a role  in the EOC to allow  to get into a “state of readiness”   Institute a “sign-off” for EOC role competencies   An the EOC technological and physical needs assessment is required  to ensure updated processes and procedures, along with the  appropriate, updated and necessary tools, are in place   Update and enforce consistent registration and ID tag process and  procedures   Establish an “EOC Security Officer ” role   Encourage all Strathcona County departments to strategize and  suggest other potential contributions all Strathcona County departments staff could make in the EOC during an emergent event   As research into best practices indicates that ICS is becoming the  national standard for handling emergency situations in both Canada  and the United States, future Strathcona EOC activations will be  transitioning towards an ICS-based operation. A training program  on ICS ideology and principles has been initiated for all potential  EOC staff, to be reinforced through practical application by means  of table-top and mock disaster exercises         2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services -Section E – Public Communications  The following section deals with all public communications, specifically  public alerting, updates and media notification. Information for the following  section was provided by Communications Department through a review of their  files, telephone and website logs, staff accounts and anecdotal evidence.      1. the  Strathcona County Emergency Preparedness PlanThroughout the course of 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire, Strathcona  County Communications Department worked closely with SCES and others in  the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). SCES and others in  the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) role was to ensure that  consistent information was made available in a timely manner to a range of  stakeholders as the incident evolved.   1.1 Observations  Communications personnel  were involved in the incident from  Sunday, May 3 when the EOC initially  opened, and throughout the week  while the EOC was in operation.  Although the need for E – Public Communications  assistance was reduced considerably  after the EOC closed, the need for a  certain level of support continued,  gradually tapering off, for a number of  weeks. the need for a  certain level of support extended through  May and June in the form of updates to  the UPDATEline11, 211 and the County  website, with the last update provided on July 2. Topics included the fire ban,  periodic local traffic notices and safety messages as work on extinguishing area  hotspots continued.                                                               11 The UPDATEline is a 24-hour recorded information line operated by the Northeast Region Community  Awareness Emergency Response (NR CAER) to provide important information on industrial activity  and  ongoing emergent situations. (http:/ .nrcaer.com  /  UPDATEline    -US .aspx )  2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 43 - December  2010  1.2 Findings  Communication during the wildfires was based on the following key points:   Use all available communications methods and media.    Repeat referrals to basic information sources, specifically the  UPDATEline and the Strathcona County website. Over the course  of the wildfires, the media made use of these as well as the public.   Provide regular and frequent updates even when the situation  shows little to no change. This serves to reassure and confirm that  the message does indeed contain the most up to date information.       Anticipate questions and feedback from the public and centralize  the flow of information through a single source, the Emergency  Public Information Officer (EPIO) Communications Team.    Provide clear, consistent messaging. Where personal safety or  property is at risk, information needs to be unambiguous, consistent  and readily available.   During 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire, the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) was generally successful in maintaining  good communication; few or no instances were identified of misinformation or  cases where people did not feel people were adequately informed.  A prime consideration was  communication with residents in the  immediate area; in other words, the  municipality’s duty to inform the public  of the potential for rapidly worsening  conditions and the possibility of  evacuation.  Another key audience  was area industry. Accurate and timely  information enabled Another key audience   to take the  necessary steps to mitigate any  cascading affect the fire might have  had on Another key audience   facilities. Given the size and intensity of the fire, there was also  considerable interest from the news media and the community at large.       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 44 - December  2010                                2. Communication tools   As indicated previously, a variety of communication tools were used to  ensure rapid, comprehensive and timely dispersal of information to both the  public and the media as the incident progressed.  Communication tools    ranged from  messages released via internet and telecommunications-based technology to  resident information packages hand-distributed to evacuees in hard copy format.   2.1 Observations  A total of 13 news releases and updates went to the media via email  between May 3 and 8. Each release was approved by SCESrepresentative in the EOC. Communications staff, in Communications staff role of Emergency  Public Information Officers (EPIO), served as the first point of contact for media  inquiries, with SCES officers providing all follow-up comments to the media and  1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   the  Strathcona County Emergency Preparedness Plan requires reorganization for immediacy   and ease of use   Message templates need to be readily available for web, news  media, phone centre, resident information, etc.   More staff need to be recruited and trained in the Emergency Public  Information Officer (EPIO)1 role to allow for redundancy and staff  rotation during multiple operational periods for incidents of longer  duration. Communications, in conjunction with the pilot SCEMA, has  already addressed this situation through The ICS EPIO “course held for all communications staff from across the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA).   Messages should be disseminated using as wide a variety of  communication tools as possible to ensure a rapid, comprehensive  and timely dispersal of accurate and consistent information      1 The ICS EPIO “serves as the conduit for information to internal and external stakeholders, including  the media…, seeking information directly from the incident or event” (City of Edmonton Office of  Emergency Preparedness, July 2009, p. 41).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 45 - December  2010  doing all interviews. This included interviews in person at the Incident Command  Post (ICP) and via the phone from the EOC. In order to better accommodate the  many media requests, daily media briefings were scheduled for May 5 and 6 at  prearranged times on-site at the ICP.   E – Public Communications   also prepared and posted over 16 wildfire updates to the  Strathcona County website between Sunday, May 3, at 18:15 hours and Friday,  May 8, at 11:30 hours.  Furthermore, as new information was released by the EOC, the EOC was electronically circulated via an email list to interested stakeholders,  including industry, business, County staff, neighboring municipalities, SRD, MLAs  and other affected parties.   To ensure a comprehensive distribution of messages, E – Public Communications  also utilized telecommunications technology. During the period from May 3 to  May 11, 13 emergency messages were posted on the UPDATELine, which were  listened to 493 times. In addition to the emergency messages, 11 information  messages were also posted and accessed 143 times. 16 wildfire updates continued  through to the end of June as work continued at the site. County information was  also provided to the Alberta Wildfires Update Line. the Alberta Wildfires Update Line is coordinated by the  Community Relations Staff at Alberta Sustainable Resource Development (SRD)  in conjunction with affected municipalities.   In addition to pre-recorded messages, E – Public Communications   also assisted with  three emergency warning call-outs to residents, all done through the North east  Region Community Awareness Emergency Response (NR CAER) the Northeast Region Community  Notification System (CNS)12 (May 4: voluntary evacuation, May 5: mandatory  evacuation, May 7: evacuation lifted).   Anticipating calls from the public as a result of the wildfires, a Telephone  Inquiry Centre was established at 13:00 hours on May 4. a Telephone  Inquiry Centre received all  approved information updates from the EOC and was staffed by County  employees who could answer calls, convey messages to the EOC, or otherwise  assist callers. Telephone Centre staff worked a total of 66.5 hours between May  4 and May 8 and took 68 calls.                                                                12 The Northeast Region CAER CNS is an automated call-out system used to inform Strathcona residents  about more serious incidents in Strathcona residents   immediate area. In emergency situations, residents who have  registered for this service will receive a phone call with safety information and instructions.  (http:/ .nrcaer.com       - US .aspx )      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 46 - December  2010  During the incident, Strathcona  County Communications Department also piloted the use of this service. Message scripts were conveyed to 211 operators through the  Information and Volunteer Centre (IVC), and County website and phone lines  referred after-hour callers to this service. Updated information and answers to  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) were provided throughout May and into  June when the fire ban in their immediate area took effect.   On Friday, May 8, as Fire Chief Reid arranged to meet with residents  returning to May 8, as Fire Chief Reid arranged to meet with residents   homes, Communications prepared hard copy information  packages to be left with each returning family. hard copy information  packages to be left with each returning family included a  message with key contact information, FireSmart and other materials.  No  specific feedback was obtained with regard to this communication tool.  For samples of messages and information packages, please see  Appendix 7.  2.2 Findings  a) Media releases, briefings and interviews   Providing news releases and updates to the media via email proved  extremely efficient and was well received by media representatives, as were the  regularly scheduled briefings.  Having SCES Command Officers available for  interviews also proved particularly effective in providing context and first-hand  experience to supplement the general information provided through the updates.   As the incident was winding down, all incident-related media enquiries  were directed to a special email address (emergencyinfo@strathcona.ab.ca)  previously created for this purpose as a result of learnings from the 2008 fire and  many industrial responses. This proved very effective and has since become an  integral part of ongoing SCES public communication protocols.   b) Strathcona County Website (www.strathcona.ab.ca)   The week of May 4 saw the largest number of daily visits in the history of  the County website, due in part to the number of people seeking information  about 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire. The wildfire page received 1,012 visits on Tuesday, May 5,  making The wildfire page the second-most visited page on b) Strathcona County Website (www.strathcona.ab.ca)    (total visits that day to the  County website: 6,548). The wildfire page was also the second-most visited page on the  following day (Wednesday, May 6) with a total of 1,122 visits (total visits to the  site that day: 5,975).  It is not unreasonable to suggest that this statistic supports  the claim that regular updates are necessary, even if the message stays the      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 47 - December  2010  same. Not only does this reassure the public that the public are receiving the latest  and most up to date information, this also has the potential of reducing  unauthorized activity within the response. In fact, research has proven that  “access to information (or lack thereof) is a key factor” in whether or not such  activity occurs (Fowler, 2008, p.v).  c) Email updates   The above claim is also supported by the manner in which the emailed  information updates were received by those on the email list referred to  previously.  which the emailed  information updates were well received and widely circulated, as  evidenced by the following comment from an industry communicator: “The news  releases  were great – which the emailed  information updates were brief, to the point and read well via  BlackBerry. I think this is also a great way to get info to employees and  contractors and keep employees and  contractors informed”.  d) The UPDATELine, 1-866-653-9959  It is interesting to note the unprecedented use of this communication tool  by Strathcona County residents and visitors at the height of the incident.  Typically, The UPDATEline is only accessed around 300 times per month. During 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire, The UPDATEline was accessed over 600 times in the first  week alone.    Since that time, SCES has both taken advantage of and encouraged a  continued heightened public awareness of this communication tool by expanding  SCES role in ongoing SCES public communication protocols.  Information messages  on topics ranging from live fire training and fire ban announcements to air quality  advisories are now routinely posted on The UPDATEline.   e) Community Notification System (CNS) Call-outs   Although Strathcona  County Communications Department has had access to the NR CAER CNS since  the NR CAER CNS inception in early 2003, e) Community Notification System (CNS) had rarely, if ever, been utilized by County  staff. Although operator training had been initially provided, these skills had not  been maintained either through practice or actual use in the intervening years. As  a result, the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) was unable to independently launch e) Community Notification System (CNS) when  required. Instead, Communications staff prepared and recorded the message for  the NR CAER Communications Officer, Brenda Gheran, who handled the actual  launch to the designated area.        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 48 - December  2010  In addition to the operational complexities of the launch, several instances  came to light of affected residents not being registered for call-outs. 2009 North Strathcona Wildfiretherefore not only highlighted operational gaps in the notification process, 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire also  provided an opportunity for the end user to see the value of registering for this  community emergency notification system.  f) Telephone Inquiry Centre  To help centralize information flow during emergencies, Strathcona’s  Communications Plan calls for a Telephone Inquiry Centre to be set up in  Meeting Room A in County Hall. Only the main County switchboard number  (780-464-8111) is publicized; the receptionist receives all calls and directs all calls  to one of the phones located in Meeting Room A.  While the number of calls received in this case was not excessively large,  this case is nonetheless worthwhile to activate this centralized source and be prepared to  adjust the number of staff available to answer calls should the situation change.   g) 211  This was the first time Strathcona  County Communications Department has used the 211 service to  disseminate information. It was particularly useful in this case as the line is in  operation on weekends and evenings. Feedback indicated a number of callers  utilized the 211 option for information, particularly with respect to ATV use in the  area affected by wildfires.            2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Incorporating and optimizing the use of a special email address for  media inquiries provides a single, trusted and convenient source of  information for the media.    For media briefings, it is important to provide enough notice to allow  for travel to the location. Prearranged times and locations are  beneficial when an event is anticipated to be prolonged, however,  further consideration is required on how to better accommodate  media at the site. Assigning a special “media area” outside the  incident perimeter, and arranging a “media pool”1 are two common  methods of achieving this result. continued next page    1 Media Pooling generally involves one print, one radio and one TV representative, selected by the  media, themselves, who are allowed within the site under escort “to get the story on the understanding  that all outlets will have access to the resulting images, information and interviews”   (AEMA, 2008, p.57).      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 45 - December  2010  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 49 - December  2010              2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned  (cont’d)   A consistent and constantly updated message is a key factor in  increasing public confidence in response efforts and lessening  the potential for emergent activity.   Use of 24 hour tools such as the UPDATEline and 211 for  dissemination of information to the public is highly effective,  provided that the information obtained from these sources is  always accurate and up to date.     Although further technical training and practice for in-house  launch of the CNS call-out system is required, the CNS call-out system did  work as intended during the incident; residents were alerted. the incident demonstrates to both residents and staff that the CNS call-out systemis effective, and stresses the value of registering for this service.   A single, central number for public inquiries proved effective;  however, the capacity of the current physical set up would be  taxed in a more widespread incident.    Clear protocols for delivering messages and information to and  from the EOC require further development.   It is essential to be well prepared with more staff on stand-by to  handle calls in case the situation escalates.  The willingness of  staff to work in the Telephone Inquiry Centre on short notice was  impressive; however, the process of training, scheduling and  recruiting phone centre staff requires refinement.          2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services -Section F – Remediation and Cost Recovery  Section F – Remediation deals with remediation efforts undertaken in their immediate area, as well  as subsequent cost recovery measures.  Emergency Management generally  refers to this as the Recovery phase of an incident.       1. Remediation   Information for this segment was derived from the files, debriefing notes  and anecdotal evidence supplied by the various departments involved in the  recovery phase of the incident.   1.1 Observations:  On June 16, 2009, in conjunction with the North Strathcona Contact Office  (Corporate Planning & Intergovernmental Affairs [CPIA]), SCES held an open  house at Fire Station #4, Heartland Hall, for residents in north Strathcona who  were affected by the incident.  Councillor Fenske, Fire Chief Darrell Reid, Deputy  Fire Chiefs Bushell and Elliott and the Heartland Service Area and Rural Liaison  Coordinator, Dinah Canart, were on hand to give presentations describing the  events and outcomes of the incident and to answer resident questions and  concerns.     Actual recovery and remediation efforts were initiated in the months of  August, September and October. Work was awarded to contracted services  managed by County staff and was completed by December 1, 2009. In the end,  over three kilometers of dozer guard and fence lines were repaired.  1.2 Findings  a) Resident Feedback  The Resident Information Open House on June 16 was well attended.   Information presented to the residents included overviews on operations,  challenges faced during the incident and other emergency management issues.   Feedback from residents was generally positive; some concerns were raised   and duly addressed, including control of the recreational area and possible  improvements to communications. A major resident concern, that SCES did not  fully utilize resources present at the scene, was dispelled through provision of the      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 51 - December  2010  fact that the resource in question had been self deployed; in other words, the resource in question was  operating independently of SCES command. As previously mentioned in Section  C-1.2 a) of Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 51 - December  , research has shown not only that such “spontaneous  organizations often outstrip the capacity of emergency managers to effectively  utilize such “spontaneous  organizations”, but “may [also] create serious problems for first responders”  (McEntire, 2004, p.16). For these and other reasons (including cost concerns), a  decision was made not to include this particular resource in the official response.   Another issue raised was the great deal of time Another issue raised was taking for the  County to repair land and fences damaged by fire operations.  The explanation  for this delay was that the Municipal Wildfire Assistance Program (MWAP) was  available to cover the repairs for this fire and the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) wanted to ensure  residents were aware of this.  b) Fire Breaks and Fence Lines  In addition to damage caused by this fire, fence lines on both public  and private land had been compromised to enable the movement of equipment  for fire operations. Furthermore, in order to contain this fire, crews created “dozer  guards” (fire breaks), which is the clearing of forested areas to restrict the  movement of fire and prevent the  movement of fire from “crowning” through trees and brush.    Throughout August, September and October, SCES representatives  worked with legal advice to develop a formal and consistent method of:   identifying property requiring any repairs   meeting with residents to review repair requirements   receiving and verifying formal repair requests, and developing a work  plan for completion  Overall, repairs to property were restricted to damaged fence lines and  areas where bulldozers had dug dozer guards (i.e. removed standing trees and  cultivated the ground to minimize the availability of fuel). Representatives from  both SCES and Transportation and Agriculture Services (TAS) visited affected  residents to establish an exact estimate of restoration requirements. The  following deductions were derived by using Alberta Sustainable Resource global  positioning to corroborate the information provided by residents:   Approximately 8,529 meters of fire break was constructed;  approximately 3,100 meters was on land owned by corporations       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 52 - December  2010   A number of smaller fire breaks had been built immediately off lease  roads on private land in the northern part of their immediate area. By late summer,  A number of smaller fire breaks had already witnessed substantial re-growth.   Actual repairs came to an estimated cost of $125,000, and consisted of:   re-grading the land   fixing fence lines damaged or cut during response operations   mulching felled trees   planting grass seed where requested by the landowner.  One concern raised by a resident during this process dealt with the fact  that “cleaning” dozer guard areas would actually improve access for off-road  vehicles. This is a serious concern, as the possibility of increased human activity  could increase the risk of future fire in their immediate area.                      2. Cost Recovery   Information for the following section was provided by Executive  Administration, Community Services Division through a review of Executive  Administration, Community Services Division files, staff  accounts and anecdotal evidence.   2.1 Observations  An application for recovery of costs associated with the      2009 North Strathcona Wildfire was made on September 11, 2009 to the Municipal Wildfire  1.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned   Open communication can greatly increase public confidence in  response and remediation efforts   Further investigation is required on adequate control of human  activity in natural areas for the purpose of reduced fire risk              2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 45 - December  2010  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 53 - December  2010  Assistance Program (MWAP)13.  The actual cost of this fire was $4.7 million; An application for recovery of costs associated with the 2009 North  Strathcona Wildfire was based on $4.2 million in eligible incident costs.  From this, the  County expected to receive $2.6 million, representing an estimated claim of  $2,700 for emergency operations, $150,000 for infrastructure damage and  $2,400,000 for firefighting .   AEMA acknowledged receipt of An application for recovery of costs associated with the 2009 North  Strathcona Wildfire on September 15 and  advised approval of the program for Strathcona on November 26, 2009. In June  2010, Strathcona  County Communications Department received a payment from MWAP of just over   $2.1 million.   2.2 Findings  According to MWAP guidelines, the municipality is “eligible for  reimbursement of all costs associated with the suppression of 2009 North Strathcona Wildfire”. As 2009 North Strathcona Wildfireoccurred in the rural service area, a formal request was made (and accepted) for  the program to use only the rural population (26,112) in reimbursement  calculations (Strathcona County, 2009, p.2). a formal request was based on the  Order in Council designating Strathcona  County Communications Department as a specialized municipality  (referred to in Section A), and substantially increased the Strathcona  County Communications Department’s potential  reimbursement amount.   In total, the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) originally anticipated recovering approximately $2.6  million under  the program to use only the rural population (26,112) in reimbursement  ; we received $2.1 million, representing a total  difference of approximately $529,000 between what was claimed and what was  paid. This was due to the fact that some costs were considered ineligible under  the program and costs for emergency service vehicles and materials such as  hoses, goggles and nozzles were paid at a greatly discounted rate. This is  something to keep in mind for future incidents requiring the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) to accrue  expected cost recovery.  The MWAP application itself, completed by the Coordinator, Financial  Systems and the Accountant, Community Services (Executive Administration),  on behalf of SCES, required copies of every invoice related to the fire, as well as  copies of all related payroll and vehicle cost records. Collecting said records  proved an onerous task; although staff from all affected departments responded  fairly quickly, there is a great deal of paperwork and effort involved in such a  request on such short notice. It is suggested that, should this issue arise in                                                              13 MWAP is a province wide program “intended to help reduce both the risk and losses associated with  wildfires…designed to assist municipalities with extraordinary costs for the suppression of wildfires when  the suppression of wildfires occur (http:/ .municipalaffairs.alberta.ca  .pdf).       2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 54 - December  2010  future, a clearer explanation of the significance of the task (and Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 54 - December  2010   potential  consequential value for the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA)) should accompany any similar requests.   The fact that the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) established a sub ledger accounting code for the  fire from the very beginning was a “life saver” and greatly simplified cost tracking  efforts. a sub ledger accounting code for the  fire from the very beginning was used to record all incident-related costs except  for regular staff hours. This exclusion, however, did cause some issues with the  MWAP application. Although a detailed record of regular staff hours was also  requested, only overtime and casual temporary staff hour records could be  supplied.   2.3 Recommendations and Lessons Learned    It is unlikely that the full amount claimed for vehicles (fire vehicles  in particular) will be received under provincial reimbursement  programs. This is something to keep in mind for future incidents  requiring the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) to accrue expected cost recovery   A clear, comprehensive explanation of the significance of any  onerous task (and the pilot Strathcona  County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) potential consequential value for the  County) could facilitate staff compliance with such requests made  on short notice   A special sub ledger accounting code established at the onset of  a potentially costly event can greatly facilitate cost tracking  efforts; this should be used without exception for all incident- related costs, including regular staff hours        2009 North Strathcona Wildfire After Action Report  Strathcona County Emergency Services - 55 - December  2010  References    211 Edmonton.
